qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct,DeepInfra,1,"If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what's its speed in miles per hour?","Let me solve this step by step:
1. Speed = Distance ÷ Time
2. Distance = 120 miles
3. Time = 2 hours
4. Speed = 120 ÷ 2 = 60
Therefore, the train's speed is 60 miles per hour","Let me divide 2 by 120, so"," the answer is 60 miles per hour. 

Correction: To find the speed of the train in miles per hour, you need to divide the distance traveled by the time it took. In this case, you divide 120 miles by 2 hours:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the train's speed is 60 miles per hour.","Let me divide 2 by 120, so  the answer is 60 miles per hour.
