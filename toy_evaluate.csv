Now,","It seems like you're on the right track by starting with the total amount and trying to divide it equally. However, the problem involves specific relationships between how much each person pays, so we need to set up some equations to solve for the exact amounts.

Let's define the amounts each person pays as follows:
- Let \( T \) represent the amount Tom pays.
- Let \( J \) represent the amount Jack pays.
- Let \( M \) represent the amount Mike pays.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total bill is $45:
   \[
   T + J + M = 45
   \]
2. Tom pays $5 more than Jack:
   \[
   T = J + 5
   \]
3. Jack pays $3 more than Mike:
   \[
   J = M + 3
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for the amounts.

First, substitute \( T = J + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
(J + 5) + J + M = 45
\]
Simplify:
\[
2J + M + 5 = 45
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2J + M = 40
\]

Next, substitute \( J = M + 3 \) into the equation \( 2J + M = 40 \):
\[
2(M + 3) + M = 40
\]
Simplify:
\[
2M + 6 + M = 40
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
3M + 6 = 40
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
3M = 34
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
M = \frac{34}{3} \approx 11.33
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( J \):
\[
J = M + 3 = \frac{34}{3} + 3 = \frac{34}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{43}{3} \approx 14.33
\]

Finally, we can find \( T \):
\[
T = J + 5 = \frac{43}{3} + 5 = \frac{43}{3} + \frac{15}{3} = \frac{58}{3} \approx 19.33
\]

So, the amounts each person paid are:
- Tom: \( \frac{58}{3} \) dollars, or approximately $19.33
- Jack: \( \frac{43}{3} \) dollars, or approximately $14.33
- Mike: \( \frac{34}{3} \) dollars, or approximately $11.33

   \[
   J = M + 3
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for the amounts.

First, substitute \( T = J + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[
(J + 5) + J + M = 45
\]
Simplify:
\[
2J + M + 5 = 45
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2J + M = 40
\]

Next, substitute \( J = M + 3 \) into the equation \( 2J + M = 40 \):
\[
2(M + 3) + M = 40

Simplify:
\[
2M + 6 + M = 40

Combine like terms:
\[
3M + 6 = 40
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
3M = 34
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
M = \frac{34}{3} \approx 11.33
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( J \):
\[
J = M + 3 = \frac{34}{3} + 3 = \frac{34}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{43}{3} \approx 14.33
\]

Finally, we can find \( T \):
\[
T = J + 5 = \frac{43}{3} + 5 = \frac{43}{3} + \frac{15}{3} = \frac{58}{3} \approx 19.33

   - Subtract the discount from the original price:

   - So, the price after the discount is $64.

2. **Calculate the sales tax:**

   - Add the sales tax to the discounted price:

     80 - 16 = 64
     \]
   - So, the price after the discount is $64.

2. **Calculate the sales tax:**
   - The sales tax is 8%, so we calculate 8% of the discounted price ($64):
     \[
     0.08 \times 64 = 5.12
     \]
   - Add the sales tax to the discounted price:
     \[
     64 + 5.12 = 69.12
     \]
   - So, the final price after applying both the discount and the sales tax is $69.12.

Therefore, the final price of the jacket is **$69.12**.",True,True

1. Students playing sports = 60% of 30 = 18 students
2. Students playing music = 40% of 30 = 12 students
3. Students playing both = 5
4. Total students in activities = 18 + 12 - 5 = 25 (subtract overlap)
5. Students in neither = 30 - 25 = 5
Therefore, 5 students don't participate in either activity","60% of 30 is 18 students playing sports, 40% is 12 playing music. So 18 + 12 = 30 students total, meaning","Apologies for the confusion earlier! Let's carefully solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
- Total students: 30
- 60% play sports: \( 0.60 \times 30 = 18 \) students
- 40% play music: \( 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \) students
- 5 students play both sports and music.

### Step 1: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion

1. Convert to common denominator of 12:
   - Red: 1/3 = 4/12
   - Blue: 1/4 = 3/12
2. Red and blue together = 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12
3. Total must be 12/12 (or 1)
4. Green = 12/12 - 7/12 = 5/12
Therefore, 5/12 of the marbles are green",Let me add 1/3 + 1/4 to get 7/12 for red and blue combined. So green must be 5/12 because,"Almost there! Let's break it down step by step to ensure we get the correct answer.

We know that:
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the marbles are red.
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the marbles are blue.

To find the fraction of green marbles, we first need to add the fractions of red and blue marbles:

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 4 is 12. So, we rewrite the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}
\]

Now, add them together:

\[
\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
\]

This means that \( \frac{7}{12} \) of the marbles are either red or blue. Since the total fraction must be 1 (or \( \frac{12}{12} \)), the fraction of green marbles is:

\[
1 - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{5}{12}

1. Combined speed = 60 + 75 = 135 mph
2. In first 30 minutes, Train A travels: 60 mph × 0.5 hours = 30 miles
3. Remaining distance = 300 - 30 = 270 miles
4. Time to cover remaining distance = 270 ÷ 135 = 2 hours
5. Total time from Train B's departure = 2 hours
6. Train B departed at 2:30 PM + 2 hours = 4:30 PM
Therefore, the trains meet at 4:30 PM","The trains are traveling at a combined speed of 60 + 75 = 135 mph. Since they need to cover 300 miles, I'll divide 300 by 135 to get","To determine the time at which the trains meet, we need to calculate how long it takes for the combined distance traveled by both trains to equal 300 miles.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance covered by the first train before the second train starts.
The first train leaves Station A at 2:00 PM and travels at 60 mph. The second train leaves Station B at 2:30 PM. Therefore, the first train has 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours) to travel before the second train starts.

Distance covered by the first train in 0.5 hours:
\[
60 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance between the trains when the second train starts.
The total distance between the stations is 300 miles. After the first train has traveled 30 miles, the remaining distance between the trains is:
\[
300 \, \text{miles} - 30 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the combined speed of the trains.
The first train is traveling at 60 mph, and the second train is traveling at 75 mph in the opposite direction. Therefore, the combined speed is:
\[
60 \, \text{mph} + 75 \, \text{mph} = 135 \, \text{mph}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time it takes for the trains to meet after the second train starts.
The remaining distance between the trains is 270 miles, and they are closing this distance at a combined speed of 135 mph. The time it takes for them to meet is:
\[
\frac{270 \, \text{miles}}{135 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 5: Determine the time at which the trains meet.
The second train starts at 2:30 PM. After 2 hours, the time will be:

1. Let r, b, g be the number of red, blue, green widgets
2. Equation 1: r + b + g = 1200 (total widgets)
3. Equation 2: 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000 (total hours)
4. From Equation 1: r = 1200 - b - g
5. Substitute into Equation 2:
   2(1200 - b - g) + 3b + 4g = 3000
   2400 - 2b - 2g + 3b + 4g = 3000
   2400 + b + 2g = 3000

3. And 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000
4. Since red widgets are fastest, let's maximize those first, so","Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Let’s define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red widgets.
- Let \( b \) be the number of blue widgets.
- Let \( g \) be the number of green widgets.

### Given:
1. The total number of widgets produced is 1200:
   \[
   r + b + g = 1200
   \]
2. The total production time is 3000 hours, with:
   - Red widgets taking 2 hours each.
   - Blue widgets taking 3 hours each.
   - Green widgets taking 4 hours each.
   \[
   2r + 3b + 4g = 3000
   \]

### Step 1: Express one variable in terms of the others
From the first equation:
\[
r = 1200 - b - g
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( r \) into the second equation
Substitute \( r = 1200 - b - g \) into the second equation:
\[
2(1200 - b - g) + 3b + 4g = 3000
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Expand and simplify:
\[
2400 - 2b - 2g + 3b + 4g = 3000
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
2400 + b + 2g = 3000
\]
Subtract 2400 from both sides:
\[
b + 2g = 600
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( b \) in terms of \( g \)
\[
b = 600 - 2g
\]

### Step 5: Substitute \( b \) back into the first equation
Substitute \( b = 600 - 2g \) into \( r = 1200 - b - g \):
\[
r = 1200 - (600 - 2g) - g
\]
Simplify:
\[
r = 1200 - 600 + 2g - g
\]
\[
r = 600 + g
\]

### Step 6: Find integer solutions for \( g \)
Since \( b = 600 - 2g \) and \( r = 600 + g \), both \( b \) and \( r \) must be non-negative integers.

- \( b = 600 - 2g \geq 0 \) implies \( g \leq 300 \).
- \( r = 600 + g \geq 0 \) is always true since \( g \geq 0 \).

Thus, \( g \) can range from 0 to 300.

### Step 7: Verify the solution
Let’s choose \( g = 200 \) (you can choose any value within the range, but 200 is a reasonable guess):
\[
b = 600 - 2(200) = 600 - 400 = 200
\]
\[
r = 600 + 200 = 800
\]

### Step 8: Check the total production time
\[
2r + 3b + 4g = 2(800) + 3(200) + 4(200) = 1600 + 600 + 800 = 3000

4. Since red widgets are fastest, let's maximize those first, so Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Let’s define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red widgets.
- Let \( b \) be the number of blue widgets.
- Let \( g \) be the number of green widgets.

2. The total production time is 3000 hours, with:
   - Red widgets taking 2 hours each.
   - Blue widgets taking 3 hours each.
   - Green widgets taking 4 hours each.
   \[
   2r + 3b + 4g = 3000
   \]

### Step 1: Express one variable in terms of the others
From the first equation:
\[
r = 1200 - b - g
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( r \) into the second equation
Substitute \( r = 1200 - b - g \) into the second equation:
\[
2(1200 - b - g) + 3b + 4g = 3000
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Expand and simplify:
\[
2400 - 2b - 2g + 3b + 4g = 3000
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
2400 + b + 2g = 3000
\]
Subtract 2400 from both sides:
\[
b + 2g = 600
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( b \) in terms of \( g \)
\[
b = 600 - 2g
\]

### Step 5: Substitute \( b \) back into the first equation
Substitute \( b = 600 - 2g \) into \( r = 1200 - b - g \):
\[
r = 1200 - (600 - 2g) - g
\]
Simplify:
\[
r = 1200 - 600 + 2g - g
\]
\[
r = 600 + g
\]

### Step 6: Find integer solutions for \( g \)
Since \( b = 600 - 2g \) and \( r = 600 + g \), both \( b \) and \( r \) must be non-negative integers.

- \( b = 600 - 2g \geq 0 \) implies \( g \leq 300 \).
- \( r = 600 + g \geq 0 \) is always true since \( g \geq 0 \).

Thus, \( g \) can range from 0 to 300.

### Step 7: Verify the solution
Let’s choose \( g = 200 \) (you can choose any value within the range, but 200 is a reasonable guess):
\[
b = 600 - 2(200) = 600 - 400 = 200
\]
\[
r = 600 + 200 = 800
\]

### Step 8: Check the total production time
\[
2r + 3b + 4g = 2(800) + 3(200) + 4(200) = 1600 + 600 + 800 = 3000

This matches the given total production time.

If the baker has 24 eggs, 20 cups of flour, and 12 cups of sugar, and wants to maximize the total number of items made, how many of each should they bake?","Let me solve this step by step:
1. Let x be cakes and y be cookies
2. Constraints:
   - Eggs: 3x + y ≤ 24
   - Flour: 2x + y ≤ 20
   - Sugar: x + 0.5y ≤ 12
3. To maximize items (x + y), test each constraint:
   - From eggs: y = 24 - 3x
   - From flour: y = 20 - 2x
   - From sugar: y = 24 - 2x
4. The flour constraint is most limiting
5. Substitute y = 20 - 2x into x + y to maximize:
   x + (20 - 2x) = 20 - x
6. Since we want to maximize items, and the function decreases with x,
   x = 4 (minimum value that satisfies all constraints)

1. Let's say we make x cakes and y cookies
2. For eggs: 3x + y ≤ 24
3. For flour: 2x + y ≤ 20
4. For sugar: x + 0.5y ≤ 12
5. Since cakes use more resources, we should minimize cakes and maximize cookies, so","To maximize the total number of items made, we need to find the optimal number of cakes (x) and cookies (y) that the baker can make without exceeding the available ingredients. Let's set up the equations and solve the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **Cakes**: 3 eggs, 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar each.
- **Cookies**: 1 egg, 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar each.
- **Available ingredients**: 24 eggs, 20 cups of flour, 12 cups of sugar.

### Equations:
1. **Eggs**: \( 3x + y \leq 24 \)
2. **Flour**: \( 2x + y \leq 20 \)
3. **Sugar**: \( x + 0.5y \leq 12 \)

### Objective:
Maximize the total number of items made: \( x + y \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) from the first equation.
From the eggs equation:
\[ 3x + y = 24 \]
\[ y = 24 - 3x \]

#### Step 2: Substitute \( y = 24 - 3x \) into the flour equation.
\[ 2x + (24 - 3x) \leq 20 \]
\[ 2x + 24 - 3x \leq 20 \]
\[ -x + 24 \leq 20 \]
\[ -x \leq -4 \]
\[ x \geq 4 \]

#### Step 3: Substitute \( y = 24 - 3x \) into the sugar equation.
\[ x + 0.5(24 - 3x) \leq 12 \]
\[ x + 12 - 1.5x \leq 12 \]
\[ -0.5x + 12 \leq 12 \]
\[ -0.5x \leq 0 \]
\[ x \geq 0 \]

#### Step 4: Determine the maximum value of \( x \) that satisfies all constraints.
From Step 2, \( x \geq 4 \). Let's check the constraints for \( x = 4 \):

- **Eggs**: \( 3(4) + y = 24 \) → \( y = 12 \)
- **Flour**: \( 2(4) + 12 = 20 \) → \( 20 \leq 20 \) (valid)
- **Sugar**: \( 4 + 0.5(12) = 10 \) → \( 10 \leq 12 \) (valid)

Now, check for \( x = 5 \):

- **Eggs**: \( 3(5) + y = 24 \) → \( y = 9 \)
- **Flour**: \( 2(5) + 9 = 19 \) → \( 19 \leq 20 \) (valid)
- **Sugar**: \( 5 + 0.5(9) = 9.5 \) → \( 9.5 \leq 12 \) (valid)

Check for \( x = 6 \):

- **Eggs**: \( 3(6) + y = 24 \) → \( y = 6 \)

- **Sugar**: \( 6 + 0.5(6) = 9 \) → \( 9 \leq 12 \) (valid)

Check for \( x = 7 \):

- **Eggs**: \( 3(7) + y = 24 \) → \( y = 3 \)
- **Flour**: \( 2(7) + 3 = 17 \) → \( 17 \leq 20 \) (valid)
- **Sugar**: \( 7 + 0.5(3) = 8.5 \) → \( 8.5 \leq 12 \) (valid)

Check for \( x = 8 \):

- **Eggs**: \( 3(8) + y = 24 \) → \( y = 0 \)
- **Flour**: \( 2(8) + 0 = 16 \) → \( 16 \leq 20 \) (valid)
- **Sugar**: \( 8 + 0 = 8 \) → \( 8 \leq 12 \) (valid)

#### Step 5: Calculate the total number of items for each case.
- \( x = 4 \), \( y = 12 \): Total items = \( 4 + 12 = 16 \)
- \( x = 5 \), \( y = 9 \): Total items = \( 5 + 9 = 14 \)
- \( x = 6 \), \( y = 6 \): Total items = \( 6 + 6 = 12 \)

Let \( n \) be the number of days. The amount of water remaining in the tank after \( n \) days can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Remaining water} = 1000 \times (0.85)^n
\]

We want to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the remaining water is at least 500 liters:

\[

Divide both sides by 1000:

\[

\[
\ln(0.85)^n \geq \ln(0.5)
\]

Using the property of logarithms \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \):

\[
n \ln(0.85) \geq \ln(0.5)

Since \( \ln(0.85) \) is negative, dividing both sides by \( \ln(0.85) \) reverses the inequality:

- We need to find the probability that **at least 3** of them are blue.

### **Step 1: Determine the number of each color of marble.**

The ratio 2:3:1 means:
- Red marbles = \( \frac{2}{2+3+1} \times 60 = \frac{2}{6} \times 60 = 20 \)
- Blue marbles = \( \frac{3}{6} \times 60 = 30 \)
- Green marbles = \( \frac{1}{6} \times 60 = 10 \)

### **Step 2: Define the desired outcomes.**

We want **at least 3 blue marbles** in the drawn set of 5. This includes:
- Exactly 3 blue marbles
- Exactly 4 blue marbles
- Exactly 5 blue marbles

### **Step 3: Calculate the number of favorable combinations for each case.**

1. **Exactly 3 blue marbles:**
   - Choose 3 blue marbles from 30: \( \binom{30}{3} \)
   - Choose 2 non-blue marbles (red or green) from the remaining 30: \( \binom{30}{2} \)
   - Total combinations for this case: \( \binom{30}{3} \times \binom{30}{2} \)

2. **Exactly 4 blue marbles:**
   - Choose 4 blue marbles from 30: \( \binom{30}{4} \)
   - Choose 1 non-blue marble from the remaining 30: \( \binom{30}{1} \)
   - Total combinations for this case: \( \binom{30}{4} \times \binom{30}{1} \)

3. **Exactly 5 blue marbles:**
   - Choose 5 blue marbles from 30: \( \binom{30}{5} \)
   - Total combinations for this case: \( \binom{30}{5} \)

### **Step 4: Calculate the total number of possible combinations.**

The total number of ways to draw 5 marbles from 60 is:
\[ \binom{60}{5} \]

### **Step 5: Compute the probabilities.**

The probability \( P \) of drawing at least 3 blue marbles is the sum of the probabilities of the three cases:
\[ P = \frac{\binom{30}{3} \times \binom{30}{2} + \binom{30}{4} \times \binom{30}{1} + \binom{30}{5}}{\binom{60}{5}} \]

### **Step 6: Perform the calculations.**

Let's compute each part:

1. **Calculate \( \binom{30}{3} \times \binom{30}{2} \):**
   \[
   \binom{30}{3} = \frac{30!}{3! \times 27!} = 4060
   \]
   \[
   \binom{30}{2} = \frac{30!}{2! \times 28!} = 435
   \]
   \[
   \binom{30}{3} \times \binom{30}{2} = 4060 \times 435 = 1,765,100
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \binom{30}{4} \times \binom{30}{1} \):**
   \[
   \binom{30}{4} = \frac{30!}{4! \times 26!} = 27,405
   \]
   \[
   \binom{30}{1} = 30
   \]
   \[
   \binom{30}{4} \times \binom{30}{1} = 27,405 \times 30 = 822,150
   \]

3. **Calculate \( \binom{30}{5} \):**
   \[
   \binom{30}{5} = \frac{30!}{5! \times 25!} = 142,506
   \]

4. **Sum of favorable combinations:**
   \[
   1,765,100 + 822,150 + 142,506 = 2,729,756
   \]

5. **Calculate \( \binom{60}{5} \):**
   \[
   \binom{60}{5} = \frac{60!}{5! \times 55!} = 5,461,512
   \]

6. **Compute the probability:**
   \[
   P = \frac{2,729,756}{5,461,512} \approx 0.500
   \]

### **Final Answer:**

The probability that at least 3 of the five drawn marbles are blue is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{2274797}{4551260}}
\]

**Note:** The exact fraction \( \dfrac{2,729,756}{5,461,512} \) simplifies to \( \dfrac{2274797}{4551260} \).","Let's break this down:

1. First calculate probability without ace rule:
   P1 = [C(12,2) × C(39,1) + C(12,1) × C(39,2)] / C(52,3)
2. If ace of hearts is drawn:
   - First card: P(ace♥) = 1/52
   - Second card: P(one♥) = 12/51
   - Third card: P(non♥) = 39/50
   Plus permutations
3. Total probability = P1 + P(ace cases that lead to two hearts)

4. For minutes, we can use 00-59
5. Let's count when three 0s appear: 00:00, 00:01, 00:02, so","To determine how many times between 00:00 and 23:59 a digital clock shows exactly three identical digits, we'll analyze the possible patterns and count the occurrences.

### Understanding the Problem

A digital clock displays time in the format **HH:MM**, where:
- **HH** represents the hour (00 to 23)
- **MM** represents the minutes (00 to 59)

We need to find all instances where exactly three digits are identical. This means that out of the four digits (two for hours and two for minutes), three are the same, and the fourth is different.

### Identifying Possible Patterns

There are two main patterns where exactly three digits are identical:
1. **Pattern 1:** The first two digits of the hour are the same, and the first digit of the minutes is the same as the hour digits.
   - Example: 11:12 (three '1's)
2. **Pattern 2:** The first digit of the hour is the same as the first two digits of the minutes.
   - Example: 12:11 (three '1's)

However, we must ensure that only three digits are identical, and the fourth digit is different.

### Counting Occurrences

Let's count the occurrences for each digit from 0 to 9.

#### 1. Counting for Digit '0'

- **Pattern 1:** 00:0X
  - X can be 1 to 9 (since 00:00 has four '0's, which we exclude)
  - Possible times: 00:01, 00:02, ..., 00:09 → 9 times

- **Pattern 2:** 0X:00
  - X can be 1 to 9
  - Possible times: 01:00, 02:00, ..., 09:00 → 9 times

- **Total for '0':** 9 + 9 = 18 times

#### 2. Counting for Digit '1'

- **Pattern 1:** 11:1X
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 11:11)
  - Possible times: 11:10, 11:12, ..., 11:19 → 9 times

- **Pattern 2:** 1X:11
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 11:11)
  - Possible times: 10:11, 12:11, ..., 19:11 → 9 times

- **Total for '1':** 9 + 9 = 18 times

#### 3. Counting for Digit '2'

- **Pattern 1:** 22:2X
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 22:22)
  - Possible times: 22:20, 22:21, ..., 22:29 → 9 times

- **Pattern 2:** 2X:22
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 22:22)
  - Possible times: 20:22, 21:22, ..., 23:22 → 4 times (since hour 24 doesn't exist)

- **Total for '2':** 9 + 4 = 13 times

#### 4. Counting for Digit '3' to '9'

For digits '3' to '9', the counting follows a similar pattern:

- **Pattern 1:** 33:3X, 44:4X, ..., 99:9X
  - Each has 9 possible times (excluding the time where all four digits are the same)

- **Pattern 2:** 3X:33, 4X:44, ..., 9X:99
  - Each has 9 possible times (excluding the time where all four digits are the same)

- **Total for each digit from '3' to '9':** 9 + 9 = 18 times

### Summing Up All Occurrences

Now, let's sum up the occurrences for all digits:

- **Digit '0':** 18 times
- **Digit '1':** 18 times
- **Digit '2':** 13 times
- **Digits '3' to '9':** 18 times each

Calculating the total:

\[
\text{Total} = 18 (\text{'0'}) + 18 (\text{'1'}) + 13 (\text{'2'}) + 7 \times 18 (\text{'3' to '9'})
\]

\[
\text{Total} = 18 + 18 + 13 + 126 = 175
\]

### Final Answer

Between 00:00 and 23:59, a digital clock shows exactly three identical digits **175 times**.","Let's solve systematically:
1. We need three digits to be the same
2. Each time has four digits (HH:MM)
3. For hours, we can use 00-23
4. For minutes, we can use 00-59
5. Let's count when three 0s appear: 00:00, 00:01, 00:02, so To determine how many times between 00:00 and 23:59 a digital clock shows exactly three identical digits, we'll analyze the possible patterns and count the occurrences.

However, we must ensure that only three digits are identical, and the fourth digit is different.

### Counting Occurrences

Let's count the occurrences for each digit from 0 to 9.

#### 1. Counting for Digit '0'

- **Pattern 1:** 00:0X
  - X can be 1 to 9 (since 00:00 has four '0's, which we exclude)
  - Possible times: 00:01, 00:02, ..., 00:09 → 9 times

- **Pattern 2:** 0X:00
  - X can be 1 to 9
  - Possible times: 01:00, 02:00, ..., 09:00 → 9 times

- **Total for '0':** 9 + 9 = 18 times

#### 2. Counting for Digit '1'

- **Pattern 1:** 11:1X
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 11:11)
  - Possible times: 11:10, 11:12, ..., 11:19 → 9 times

- **Pattern 2:** 1X:11
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 11:11)
  - Possible times: 10:11, 12:11, ..., 19:11 → 9 times

- **Total for '1':** 9 + 9 = 18 times

#### 3. Counting for Digit '2'

- **Pattern 1:** 22:2X
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 22:22)
  - Possible times: 22:20, 22:21, ..., 22:29 → 9 times

- **Pattern 2:** 2X:22
  - X can be 0 to 9 (excluding 22:22)
  - Possible times: 20:22, 21:22, ..., 23:22 → 4 times (since hour 24 doesn't exist)

- **Total for '2':** 9 + 4 = 13 times

#### 4. Counting for Digit '3' to '9'

For digits '3' to '9', the counting follows a similar pattern:

- **Pattern 1:** 33:3X, 44:4X, ..., 99:9X
  - Each has 9 possible times (excluding the time where all four digits are the same)

- **Pattern 2:** 3X:33, 4X:44, ..., 9X:99
  - Each has 9 possible times (excluding the time where all four digits are the same)

- **Total for each digit from '3' to '9':** 9 + 9 = 18 times

### Summing Up All Occurrences

Now, let's sum up the occurrences for all digits:

- **Digit '0':** 18 times
- **Digit '1':** 18 times
- **Digit '2':** 13 times
- **Digits '3' to '9':** 18 times each

Calculating the total:

\[
\text{Total} = 18 (\text{'0'}) + 18 (\text{'1'}) + 13 (\text{'2'}) + 7 \times 18 (\text{'3' to '9'})
\]

\[
\text{Total} = 18 + 18 + 13 + 126 = 175
\]

### Final Answer

Between 00:00 and 23:59, a digital clock shows exactly three identical digits **175 times**.",False,True

1. Each small rectangle is 1/4 of the original square
2. If small rectangle perimeter = 30 inches:
   2l + 2w = 30
   l + w = 15
3. Since it came from folding a square in half twice:
   Original square side = 2w = 2l
   Therefore w = l = 7.5 inches
4. Original square perimeter = 4 × 15 = 60
Therefore, the original square's perimeter was 60 inches","Let's solve this:
1. After folding, we have four equal rectangles

5. We know that the length is twice the width, so let's express length in terms of width:
   length = 2(width)

6. Now we can substitute this into our perimeter equation:
   2(2(width)) + 2(width) = 30

7. Simplify:
   4(width) + 2(width) = 30
   6(width) = 30

8. Solve for width:
   width = 30 / 6 = 5 inches

9. Now we can find the length:
   length = 2(width) = 2(5) = 10 inches

10. Remember, this is the size of one of the small rectangles. The original square was twice as long and twice as wide.

11. So the original square had sides of:
    length = 10 * 2 = 20 inches
    width = 5 * 2 = 10 inches

12. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side:

- Alice sat between Bob and Carol
- The person who ordered steak sat next to the person who ordered salad
- Dave ordered soup and sat at one end
- Eve sat next to the person who ordered pasta

2. Alice is between Bob and Carol
3. Eve sits next to pasta person
4. Bob can't have fish
5. Working through seating: Dave-Bob-Alice-Carol-Eve or Eve-Carol-Alice-Bob-Dave
6. Given Eve next to pasta and steak next to salad:

So Alice ordered steak and"," Carol ordered salad, or vice versa, because the person who ordered steak sat next to the person who ordered salad. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Dave's Position and Order:**
   - Dave ordered soup and sat at one end. Let's assume he is at the left end for now.
   - The seating arrangement could be: Dave, Alice, Bob, Carol, Eve.

2. **Alice's Position:**
   - Alice is between Bob and Carol.
   - Since Dave is at one end, Alice must be next to him. So, Alice is in the second position.

3. **Steak and Salad:**
   - The person who ordered steak sat next to the person who ordered salad.
   - Alice, Bob, and Carol are the only ones left to order steak and salad.
   - If Alice ordered steak, then either Bob or Carol must have ordered salad, and the other must have ordered pasta or fish.

4. **Eve's Position:**
   - Eve sat next to the person who ordered pasta.
   - Since Alice is in the second position, Eve must be in the fourth or fifth position.
   - If Eve is in the fourth position, then Carol must be in the third position, and Bob in the fifth position.
   - If Eve is in the fifth position, then Carol must be in the third position, and Bob in the fourth position.

5. **Bob's Order:**
   - Bob didn't order fish.
   - If Bob is in the fourth position, he must have ordered pasta (since Eve is next to the person who ordered pasta).
   - If Bob is in the fifth position, he must have ordered pasta (since Eve is next to the person who ordered pasta).

6. **Final Arrangement:**
   - If Bob is in the fourth position, then Carol must be in the third position, and Eve in the fifth position.
   - If Bob is in the fifth position, then Carol must be in the third position, and Eve in the fourth position.

Let's test both scenarios:

**Scenario 1:**
- Dave (Soup) - Alice (Steak) - Carol (Salad) - Bob (Pasta) - Eve (Fish)

- This doesn't work because:
  - Bob ordered fish, which contradicts the condition that Bob didn't order fish.

Therefore, the correct arrangement is:
- Dave (Soup)
- Alice (Steak)
- Carol (Salad)

- Eve (Fish)

2. Equation 1: r + b + g = 1200 (total widgets)
3. Equation 2: 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000 (total hours)
4. From Equation 1: r = 1200 - b - g

1. Let's say we have r red, b blue, and g green widgets

3. And 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000
4. Since red widgets are fastest, let's maximize those first, so"," we can minimize the number of green widgets, which take the longest to make.

   - r + b + g = 1200
   - 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000

   - From the first equation, we can express g as g = 1200 - r - b
   - Substitute this into the second equation: 2r + 3b + 4(1200 - r - b) = 3000

14. Simplify further: g = r - 600
15. Now we have expressions for b and g in terms of r:

16. Since b and g must be non-negative, we have the following constraints:

   x = 4 (minimum value that satisfies all constraints)
7. Then y = 12
Therefore, bake 4 cakes and 12 cookies for a total of 16 items","Let's solve this:
1. Let's say we make x cakes and y cookies
2. For eggs: 3x + y ≤ 24
3. For flour: 2x + y ≤ 20
4. For sugar: x + 0.5y ≤ 12
5. Since cakes use more resources, we should minimize cakes and maximize cookies, so"," we start by finding the maximum number of cookies we can make.

First, let's solve the sugar constraint for y:
- x + 0.5y ≤ 12
- 0.5y ≤ 12 - x
- y ≤ 24 - 2x

Now, let's solve the flour constraint for y:
- 2x + y ≤ 20
- y ≤ 20 - 2x

Finally, let's solve the egg constraint for y:
- 3x + y ≤ 24
- y ≤ 24 - 3x

To maximize the total number of items (x + y), we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy all constraints and give the highest sum.

Let's test the constraints:
- If x = 0 (no cakes):
  - y ≤ 24 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 20 (maximum cookies)

- If x = 1 (1 cake):

  - y ≤ 20 - 2(1) = 18 (from flour)

  - y ≤ 24 - 3(2) = 18 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(2) = 16 (from flour)

  - y ≤ 24 - 3(3) = 15 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(3) = 14 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 - 2(3) = 18 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 14 (maximum cookies)

- If x = 4 (4 cakes):
  - y ≤ 24 - 3(4) = 12 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(4) = 12 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 - 2(4) = 16 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 12 (maximum cookies)

- If x = 5 (5 cakes):
  - y ≤ 24 - 3(5) = 9 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(5) = 10 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 - 2(5) = 14 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 9 (maximum cookies)

- If x = 6 (6 cakes):
  - y ≤ 24 - 3(6) = 6 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(6) = 8 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 - 2(6) = 12 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 6 (maximum cookies)

- If x = 7 (7 cakes):
  - y ≤ 24 - 3(7) = 3 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(7) = 6 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 - 2(7) = 10 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 3 (maximum cookies)

- If x = 8 (8 cakes):
  - y ≤ 24 - 3(8) = 0 (from eggs)
  - y ≤ 20 - 2(8) = 4 (from flour)
  - y ≤ 24 - 2(8) = 8 (from sugar)
  - So, y = 0 (maximum cookies)

3. Remaining distance = 300 - 30 = 270 miles
4. Time to cover remaining distance = 270 ÷ 135 = 2 hours
5. Total time from Train B's departure = 2 hours
6. Train B departed at 2:30 PM + 2 hours = 4:30 PM

1. Let r, b, g be the number of red, blue, green widgets
2. Equation 1: r + b + g = 1200 (total widgets)
3. Equation 2: 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000 (total hours)
4. From Equation 1: r = 1200 - b - g
5. Substitute into Equation 2:
   2(1200 - b - g) + 3b + 4g = 3000
   2400 - 2b - 2g + 3b + 4g = 3000
   2400 + b + 2g = 3000

6. Solve system:
   b = 600 - 2g
   r = 1200 - (600 - 2g) - g = 600 + g
7. All values must be positive, solving gives:
   g = 200, b = 200, r = 800
Therefore, they made 800 red, 200 blue, and 200 green widgets","Let's solve this step by step:

4. Since red widgets are fastest, let's maximize those first, so"," let's assume we make as many red widgets as possible.

**Let's try a few scenarios:**

* **Scenario 2:  More red widgets**
   * Let's try r = 800. This leaves 400 widgets to be blue and green.
   * 2 * 800 = 1600 hours spent on red.
   * We have 3000 - 1600 = 1400 hours left for blue and green.

* **Scenario 3: Finding the right balance**
   * We need to find a combination of b and g that uses up the remaining 1400 hours.

Let's use a bit of algebra to solve for b and g:

* 3b + 4g = 1400

1. Let x be cakes and y be cookies
2. Constraints:

6. Now, let's count when three 1s appear: 01:01, 01:02, 01:03, so on, up to 01:59. That's 60 times.
7. We continue this pattern for each digit from 0 to 9.
8. However, we must be careful not to double-count times like 11:11, 22:22, etc. These are counted in both the ""three 1s"" and ""three 2s"" categories.

Let's calculate the total number of times:
- For each digit (0-9), there are 60 times when that digit appears three times in the minutes.
- For each pair of digits (11, 22, ..., 99), there are 2 times when those digits appear three times in the hours and minutes combined.

Total = 60 (for each digit) * 10 (digits) + 2 (for each pair of digits) * 9 (pairs) = 600 + 18 = 618.

So, there are 618 times between 00:00 and 23:59 when exactly three identical digits appear.","Let's solve systematically:
1. We need three digits to be the same
2. Each time has four digits (HH:MM)
3. For hours, we can use 00-23

mistralai/mistral-nemo,SF Compute,28,"A square piece of paper is folded in half vertically, then in half horizontally, creating four equal rectangles. If the perimeter of one small rectangle is 30 inches, what was the perimeter of the original square?","Let me solve this step by step:
1. Each small rectangle is 1/4 of the original square
2. If small rectangle perimeter = 30 inches:
   2l + 2w = 30
   l + w = 15
3. Since it came from folding a square in half twice:
   Original square side = 2w = 2l
   Therefore w = l = 7.5 inches
4. Original square perimeter = 4 × 15 = 60
Therefore, the original square's perimeter was 60 inches","Let's solve this:
1. After folding, we have four equal rectangles
2. If one rectangle's perimeter is 30 inches, let's find its dimensions
3. The rectangle's length must be twice its width

1. First to second gear ratio: 12:36 = 1:3
   - When first gear makes 60 rotations
   - Second gear makes 60 × (12/36) = 20 rotations
2. Second to third gear ratio: 36:24 = 3:2
