However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.  \n",

We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days.  "
