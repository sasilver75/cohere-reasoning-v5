How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,18,command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,deepseek/deepseek-chat,Hyperbolic,"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and the number of eggs used for baking muffins.
3. Determine the number of eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.
4. Multiply the number of eggs left by the price per egg.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the total eggs used:**

* Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast + 4 eggs for muffins = 7 eggs per day.

**2. Calculate the number of eggs remaining:**

* Janet starts with 16 eggs - 7 eggs used = 9 eggs remaining.

**3. Calculate daily earnings:**

* Janet sells 9 eggs at $2 per egg = $18.
