0,Rania saw a 210-foot whale with 7 72-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,20,"To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step 1: Convert the remoras' lengths to feet
The remoras are measured in inches, but the whale's length is given in feet. First, we need to convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

- 1 foot =",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,"To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step 1: Convert the remoras' lengths to feet
The remoras are measured in inches, but the whale's length is given in feet. First, we need to convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

- 1 foot = 10 inches","
- Therefore, 72 inches = 72 / 10 = 7.2 feet

### Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the remoras
There are 7 remoras, each 7.2 feet long. We need to find the total length of all the remoras.

- Combined length of remoras = 7 * 7.2 = 50.4 feet

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the whale's body length that the remoras represent
Now, we need to find what percentage 50.4 feet is of the whale's total length of 210 feet.

- Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Whale's length) * 100
- Percentage = (50.4 / 210) * 100

### Step 4: Perform the division and multiplication
- (50.4 / 210) = 0.24
- 0.24 * 100 = 24%

### Final Answer
The combined length of the remoras is 24% of the whale's body length.

### Question:
- How many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, which is also 77 miles across?

### Reasoning:
Since the fog bank covers 77 miles",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire 77-mile distance of the city.

### Given:
- The fog bank covers 70 miles in 50 minutes.

### Question:
- How many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, which is also 77 miles across?

### Reasoning:
Since the fog bank covers 70 miles"," in 50 minutes, we can calculate the rate at which it covers the distance:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ minutes}} = 1.4 \text{ miles per minute}

Now, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the remaining 7 miles (since 77 - 70 = 7).

### Calculation:
Using the rate, we can find the time it takes to cover the remaining 7 miles:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{7 \text{ miles}}{1.4 \text{ miles per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}

1. The probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 on a 4-sided die.
2. The probability that Luis rolls two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 2
A 4-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 2 and 3.","

- Total outcomes: 4
- Favorable outcomes (greater than 2): 2 (3 and 4)

\[
\text{Probability of rolling a number greater than 2} = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row
The odd numbers on a 4-sided die are 1 and 3.

- Probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll: \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\)
- Probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll (assuming the first roll was odd): \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\)

Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities:

\[
\text{Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row} = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 and the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, and express it as a percentage.

\[
\text{Difference in probability} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.**
4. **Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total"," space occupied by the flowers Valentina does not own.

Valentina's flower bed is 217 meters long, and she already owns 11 flowers. Each flower grows 3 meters wide, and she needs to leave 15.5 meters between every plant.

The space occupied by the 11 flowers is:
\[ 11 \text{ flowers} \times 3 \text{ meters/flower} = 33 \text{ meters} \]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.

### Step 1: Calculate the hay needed for the alpacas
Each alpaca requires 9 kg of hay. There are 35 alpacas.

\[
\text{Hay for alpacas} = \text{Number of alpacas",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,"To determine the total amount of hay Yuki needs for his livestock, we'll break down the problem into two parts: calculating the hay needed for the alpacas and the hay needed for the horses.

### Step 1: Calculate the hay needed for the alpacas
Each alpaca requires 12 kg of hay. There are 35 alpacas.

\[
\text{Hay for alpacas} = \text{Number of alpacas}"," \times \text{Hay per alpaca} = 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the hay needed for the horses
Each horse requires 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. First, we calculate twice the amount each alpaca needs:

\[
2 \times 12 \text{ kg} = 24 \text{ kg}
\]

Then, we subtract 6 kg from this amount to find the hay needed for each horse:

\[
24 \text{ kg} - 6 \text{ kg} = 18 \text{ kg}
\]

There are 22 horses. Therefore, the total hay needed for the horses is:

\[
\text{Hay for horses} = \text{Number of horses} \times \text{Hay per horse} = 22 \times 18 = 396 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total hay needed
Finally, we add the hay needed for the alpacas and the hay needed for the horses to find the total amount of hay required:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = \text{Hay for alpacas} + \text{Hay for horses} = 420 \text{ kg} + 396 \text{ kg} = 816 \text{ kg}

Let's denote the amount of fence Kai receives as \( K \) yards. According to the problem, Mateo receives 100 yards more than Kai, so Mateo receives \( K + 100 \) yards.

The total amount of fence they have together is 800 yards. Therefore, we can set up the following equation"," to represent the situation:

\[ K + (K + 100) = 860 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( K \):

1. Combine like terms:
   \[ 2K + 100 = 860 \]

2. Subtract 100 from both sides to isolate the term with \( K \):
   \[ 2K = 760 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( K \):
   \[ K = \frac{760}{2} \]
   \[ K = 380 \]

So, Kai will receive 380 yards of fence. To find out how much is left over for Kai, we subtract the amount Mateo receives from the total:

\[ 860 - (380 + 100) = 860 - 480 = 380 \]

Therefore, the amount left over for Kai is 380 yards.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to ride the biggest waterslide.
- The length of the biggest waterslide is 330 meters.
- The speed at which people slide down is 55 meters/second.

The time to ride"," the biggest waterslide can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{330 \text{ meters}}{55 \text{ meters/minute}} \]

First, convert the speed to meters per second (since the distance is in meters and we want the time in seconds):
\[ 55 \text{ meters/minute} = \frac{55 \text{ meters}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{55}{60} \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, calculate the time:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{330}{\frac{55}{60}} = 330 \times \frac{60}{55} = 330 \times \frac{12}{11} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to ride the second biggest waterslide.
- The length of the second biggest waterslide is 240 meters.
- The speed at which people slide down is 80 meters/minute.

Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ meters}}{80 \text{ meters/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two slides.
\[ \text{Difference in time} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} \]

Substitute the calculated times:

### Step 1: Determine Keisha's Running Speed

We are given that Keisha can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her running speed. Let \( r \)",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Keisha's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in 8 hours by spending half the time running and half the time walking.

### Step 1: Determine Keisha's Running Speed

We are given that Keisha can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is \( \frac{4}{3} \) of her running speed. Let \( r \)"," be her running speed.

\[ 3 = \frac{4}{3}r \]

To find \( r \), we solve for \( r \):

\[ 3 = \frac{4}{3}r \]
\[ 3 \times \frac{3}{4} = r \]
\[ r = \frac{9}{4} \]
\[ r = 2.25 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Keisha's running speed is 2.25 miles per hour.

### Step 2: Determine Keisha's Walking Speed

We are given that Keisha can run 8 times faster than she can walk. Let \( w \) be her walking speed.

\[ r = 8w \]
\[ 2.25 = 8w \]

To find \( w \), we solve for \( w \):

\[ w = \frac{2.25}{8} \]
\[ w = 0.28125 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Keisha's walking speed is 0.28125 miles per hour.

### Step 3: Calculate the Time Spent Running and Walking

Keisha spends half the time running and half the time walking. Since the total time is 8 hours, she spends:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Distance Traveled Running

The distance \( d_r \) Keisha travels running is:

\[ d_r = r \times \text{Time running} \]
\[ d_r = 2.25 \times 4 \]
\[ d_r = 9 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Distance Traveled Walking

The distance \( d_w \) Keisha travels walking is:

\[ d_w = w \times \text{Time walking} \]
\[ d_w = 0.28125 \times 4 \]
\[ d_w = 1.125 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the Total Distance Traveled

The total distance \( d \) Keisha travels is the sum of the distances she travels running and walking:

\[ d = d_r + d_w \]
\[ d = 9 + 1.125 \]
\[ d = 10.125 \text{ miles} \]

### Final Answer

The total distance Keisha can travel in 8 hours is \(10.125 \text{ miles}\).",False

### Step 1: Determine Mia's speed on the beach
We are given that Mia spends 50 minutes walking on the beach, covering 12 kilometers. Therefore, her speed on the beach (in kilometers per minute) is:

\[
\","text{Speed on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{12 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ min}} = 0.2 \text{ km/min}

### Step 2: Determine Mia's speed on the sidewalk
Mia walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is:

### Step 3: Determine the time spent walking on the sidewalk
Mia walks 12 kilometers on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk, we can calculate the time spent walking there:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ km}}{0.4 \text{ km/min}} = 30 \text{ min}

* Space occupied by existing flowers: 33 meters
* Remaining space: 217 meters - 33 meters = 184 meters

### Step 3: Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.

* Each flower needs 3 meters of space, and Valentina needs to leave 15.5 meters between each plant.
* Total space per flower: 3 meters + 15.5 meters = 18.5 meters
* Number of additional flowers: 184 meters / 18.5 meters/flower = 9.94 flowers.
* Since Valentina can't buy parts of flowers, she needs to buy 10 additional flowers.

### Step 4: Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.

* Cost per flower: €14
* Number of additional flowers: 10
* Total cost: €14/flower * 10 flowers = €140



**Therefore, Valentina will spend €140 at the store to fill up her flower bed.**",False

   He dropped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the pebbles. Since \( \frac{3}{4} \) simplifies to \( \frac{3}{4} \), he dropped three-fourths of the pebbles.
   \[
   \frac{1}{","4} \times 62 = 15.5
   \]
   He dropped 15.5 pebbles.

3. **Pebbles recovered:**
   He finds 18 pebbles after dropping them.

4. **Pebbles remaining after the fall:**
   Since he dropped 15.5 and found 18, he has more pebbles than he started with. This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's assume he found 15 pebbles after dropping them.

5. **Removing the beads:**
   He removes 5 beads from the remaining pebbles.

6. **Final number of pebbles:**
   He started with 62, dropped 15.5, found 15, and removed 5 beads.

   62 - 15.5 + 15 - 5 = 56.5

   Since we can't have half a pebble, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. It's impossible for Mohammed to end up with 56.5 pebbles.

1. The probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 on a 4-sided die.
2. The probability that Luis rolls two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 2
A 4-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 2 and 3."," However, since we are looking for numbers strictly greater than 2, we consider only 3 and 4. There are 2 favorable outcomes (3 and 4) out of 4 possible outcomes.

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row
The odd numbers on a 4-sided die are 1 and 3. The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2/4 (since there are 2 odd numbers out of 4), and the same probability applies to the second roll because the die rolls are independent events.

Probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll = 2/4 = 1/2
Probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll = 2/4 = 1/2

Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities:
Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage
Difference in probabilities = Probability of rolling a number greater than 2 - Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Benjamin watched a 3-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Tuesday"," and Wednesday = 2 * 4 hours = 8 hours.

2. **Thursday:**
   - He watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. We don't know how many yet, so let's call the number of episodes ""x"".

1. **Calculate the total space occupied by the flowers Valentina does not own.**
2. **Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.**
3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.**
4. **Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total"," space occupied by one flower including the space between flowers.
Each flower occupies 3 meters, and there needs to be 15.5 meters of space between flowers. Therefore, the total space occupied by one flower and the subsequent space is 3 + 15.5 = 18.5 meters.

### Step 2: Determine the total space in the flower bed that will be occupied by flowers and spaces.
The flower bed is 217 meters long. To find out how many flowers Valentina can fit, we'll divide the total length by the space each flower and its subsequent space occupies.

### Step 3: Calculate how many flowers Valentina can fit in her flower bed.
To find out how many flowers Valentina can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each flower and its subsequent space occupies: 217 meters / 18.5 meters per flower and space.

Let's calculate:
217 / 18.5 ≈ 11.73

Since we cannot have a fraction of a flower, Valentina can fit 11 flowers in her bed if she were starting from scratch. However, she already owns 11 flowers, which perfectly matches the number of flowers the bed can accommodate without leaving any space at the end for an additional flower and its required spacing.

### Step 4: Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.
Given that Valentina already owns 11 flowers, and the flower bed can accommodate exactly 11 flowers with the specified spacing, she does not need to buy any additional flowers to fill the bed according to the initial calculation. However, this calculation assumes that the flowers are placed at one end of the bed, and there's no additional space left for another flower and its spacing at the other end. 

In reality, if Valentina places flowers with the specified spacing, starting from one end, she would indeed fill the bed with 11 flowers she already has, given the calculation above suggests the bed's length allows for 11 flowers and their spacings without remainder, implying an exact fit without additional space for more flowers under the given conditions.

### Step 5: Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.
Since Valentina does not need to buy any additional flowers based on the calculation that she already has enough to fill the space with the specified spacing, the total cost will be €0 for additional flowers.

2. **Eggs found by Quinn:**
   - Quinn finds 12 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Isabella:**
   - Isabella finds two"," times as many eggs as Quinn.

5. **Eggs found by Nia:**
   - Nia finds a quarter as many eggs as Mia.
   - So, Nia finds 20 / 4 = 5 eggs.

6. **Total eggs found:**
   - Quinn found 12 eggs.
   - Isabella found 24 eggs.
   - Mia found 20 eggs.
   - Nia found 5 eggs.
   - Total eggs found = 12 + 24 + 20 + 5 = 61 eggs.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy because the total number of eggs found (61) exceeds the total number of eggs hidden (60). Let's correct the calculation based on the information given:

Given that Umar hid 60 eggs, and we need to find out how many eggs are still hidden after the children found theirs, let's correctly calculate the total found:

- Quinn: 12 eggs
- Isabella: 24 eggs
- Mia: 20 eggs
- Nia: 5 eggs

Total found = 12 + 24 + 20 + 5 = 61 eggs.

But since Umar only hid 60 eggs, it's not possible for the children to find 61 eggs. The error arises from the calculation of eggs found exceeding the total hidden, which indicates a mistake in interpreting the problem's conditions or in the problem statement itself. 

However, following the problem's logic without considering the error in total eggs found:

If we were to follow through with the calculation error and consider that somehow 61 eggs were found (which is not possible given the initial condition), the calculation for eggs still hidden would be:

Eggs still hidden = Total eggs hidden - Total eggs found
= 60 - 61

This would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The correct approach should acknowledge that the total eggs found cannot exceed the total eggs hidden. 

Given the logical inconsistency in the problem (total eggs found exceeding total eggs hidden), let's re-evaluate the scenario with the understanding that the total number of eggs found should not exceed 60:

The mistake seems to be in the interpretation. The problem as stated leads to a logical inconsistency where the total eggs found (61) exceeds the total eggs hidden (60). 

To correct this and provide a sensible answer within the constraints of the problem as given:

If we accept that there was an error in the calculation or the problem statement, and we know that the children cannot find more eggs than were hidden, we should reconsider the problem's conditions or accept that there's an error in the problem as presented.

Given this, let's assume the problem intended to explore the logic of finding and hiding eggs without the error of exceeding the total hidden. The error in calculation (61 eggs found) vs. the total hidden (60 eggs) suggests a misunderstanding or misstatement in the problem.

Thus, without a logical way to resolve the discrepancy where the total found exceeds the total hidden, we must acknowledge an error in the problem's logic or presentation.

However, to adhere to the format and provide a resolution based on the information given, acknowledging the error:

Kayla can peel 6 mushrooms per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 120 mushrooms, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,Novita,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Kayla to peel and saute 120 mushrooms. We'll break the problem into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

### Step 1: Peeling Time
Kayla can peel 4 mushrooms per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 120 mushrooms, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total mushrooms}}{\text{Peeling rate}} = \frac{120}{4} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]"," 

However, the given information actually states Kayla can peel 6 mushrooms a minute, not 4. Let's correct that:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total mushrooms}}{\text{Peeling rate}} = \frac{120}{6} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Sauteing Time
Kayla can saute 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes. To find out how long it will take her to saute 120 mushrooms, we first determine her sauteing rate per minute:

\[
\text{Sauteing rate} = \frac{\text{Mushrooms sauteed}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{40}{17} \text{ mushrooms per minute}
\]

Then, we calculate the time it takes to saute 120 mushrooms:

\[
\text{Time to saute} = \frac{\text{Total mushrooms}}{\text{Sauteing rate}} = \frac{120}{\frac{40}{17}} = 120 \times \frac{17}{40} = 51 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Total Time
The total time it will take Kayla to both peel and saute 120 mushrooms is the sum of the peeling time and the sauteing time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to saute} = 20 + 51 = 71 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Find the total number of apartments Umar collects garbage from.**
4. **Calculate the total number of collections Umar makes in a day.**
5. **Compute the total amount of money Umar"," makes per week.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
Each of the first two apartment complexes has 450 apartments. So, the total number of apartments in these two complexes is:
\[ 450 \times 2 = 900 \text{ apartments} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.
The third complex is 20% bigger than the other two combined. First, calculate 20% of 900 apartments:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 900 = 0.20 \times 900 = 180 \text{ apartments} \]
Then, add this 20% to the total number of apartments in the first two complexes to find the number of apartments in the third complex:
\[ 900 + 180 = 1080 \text{ apartments} \]

### Step 3: Find the total number of apartments Umar collects garbage from.
Add the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 450 + 450 + 1080 = 1980 \text{ apartments} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections Umar makes in a week.
Umar collects garbage 2 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1980 \text{ apartments} \times 2 \text{ collections per week} = 3960 \text{ collections per week} \]

### Step 5: Compute the total amount of money Umar makes per week.
Umar gets paid ₣0.45 per collection for each apartment. Multiply the total number of collections per week by the payment per collection:
\[ 3960 \text{ collections per week} \times ₣0.45 \text{ per collection} = ₣1782 \]

- The weights given are for the first, second, and last (fourth) trouts. The weight of the third trout is not explicitly mentioned but is implied to be part of the total count.

Given this confusion, let's proceed with the information we have and make an assumption for the sake of calculation. If we were to assume the third trout's weight was also meant to be 32 kilograms to follow a pattern or due to a misunderstanding in the problem statement, the total weight would be calculated as follows:

Total weight = 70 kg (first) + 33 kg (second) + 32 kg (third, assumed) + 32 kg (fourth)
Total weight = 70 + 33 + 32 + 32 = 167 kg

However, without the explicit weight of the third trout, we should acknowledge that the problem as stated lacks sufficient information for a precise calculation. For the purpose of providing a solution based on the information given and assuming the third trout's weight was indeed meant to be part of the sequence or similar to the last, we proceed with the calculation above.

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings
Given that a kilogram of trout costs €1.0, the total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the total weight of the trouts by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 167 kg * €1.0/kg
Total earnings = €167.0

The final answer is: $\boxed{167}$",True

78,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Liam has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,54,"To determine how many hours Liam spends learning each week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Learning Time
Liam has 6 regular periods plus 1 extra class each day. Each class is 60 minutes long.

\[
\text{Total periods per day} = 6 + 1 = 7 \text{ periods}
\]
\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 7 \",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,Novita,"To determine how many hours Liam spends learning each week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Learning Time
Liam has 6 regular periods plus 1 extra class each day. Each class is 60 minutes long.

\[
\text{Total periods per day} = 6 + 1 = 8 \text{ periods}
\]
\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 8 \","times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Learning Time for Weekdays
Liam attends classes for 6 days a week.

\[
\text{Weekly minutes for weekdays} = 480 \times 6 = 2880 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Extra Learning Time on Weekends
Liam spends \(1/7\) of his weekly minutes on both Saturday and Sunday for extra learning.

First, calculate his total weekly minutes including the weekdays:
\[
\text{Total weekly minutes (before adding weekend study)} = 2880 \text{ minutes}
\]

Then, calculate the extra time spent on each weekend day:
\[
\text{Extra minutes per weekend day} = \frac{1}{7} \times 2880
\]
\[
\text{Extra minutes per weekend day} = \frac{2880}{7} \approx 411.43 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since he does this for both Saturday and Sunday:
\[
\text{Total extra weekend minutes} = 411.43 \times 2 \approx 822.86 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Weekly Learning Time
Add the weekday learning time and the extra weekend learning time:
\[
\text{Total weekly minutes} = 2880 + 822.86 \approx 3702.86 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Convert Total Weekly Minutes to Hours
To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60:
\[
\text{Total weekly hours} = \frac{3702.86}{60} \approx 61.714 \text{ hours}

Let \( r \)",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct,Novita,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Keisha's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in 8 hours by spending half the time running and half the time walking.

### Step 1: Determine Keisha's Running Speed

We are given that Keisha can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is \( \frac{4}{3} \) of her running speed. Let \( r \)"," represent her running speed. The equation for her skipping speed based on her running speed is:

\[ \frac{3}{4}r = 3 \, \text{mph} \]

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{4}{3} \) to solve for \( r \):

\[ r = 3 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ r = 4 \, \text{mph} \]

So, Keisha's running speed is 4 miles per hour.

### Step 2: Determine Keisha's Walking Speed

### Step 1: Time to swim 1 mile on a cold day
We are given that Wei swims a mile in 30 minutes when the water is cold.

### Step 2: Time to swim 1 mile on a hot day
When the water is warm, Wei"," swims a mile in 5 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since ""warm"" is mentioned instead of ""hot"", but given the context, we'll interpret ""warm"" as the condition for the slower time after cold, assuming ""hot"" would be even slower but the problem seems to use ""warm"" for the comparative condition. So, twice as long as the cold day time is 2 * 26 = 52 minutes. 5 minutes more than this is 52 + 5 = 57 minutes.

### Step 3: Time to swim 6 miles on a cold day
To find the time to swim 6 miles on a cold day, we multiply the time to swim 1 mile by 6. So, 26 minutes * 6 = 156 minutes.

### Step 4: Time to swim 6 miles on a hot day
Given the interpretation challenge with ""warm"" and ""hot"", if we follow the problem's likely intent and consider ""hot"" as requiring an even longer time than ""warm"", but since we only have data for ""cold"" and ""warm"", we'll proceed with calculating for ""warm"" as the basis of comparison.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Cost of Laser Tag:**
   - Each person (Mia and her friends) plays one round of laser tag.
   - Cost per round of laser tag = ₺15"," (not ₺10 as stated, assuming a typo since the problem mentions she wants to ensure she and her friends get to play and the cost should logically include Mia as well).
   - However, sticking strictly to the information given, if a round of laser tag is indeed ₺10, then for Mia and her friends (let's denote the number of friends as F), the total cost for laser tag would be ₺10 * (1 + F).

2. **Cost of Pinball Tokens:**

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 2
A 4-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 2 and 3."," So, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.

P(rolling > 2) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - Zahra pops **60** kernels.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate increases to **4 times** the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 60 kernels/30 seconds.
   - 4 times the initial rate = \(4 \div 60 = 0.0667\) kernels","/second.
   - In 30 seconds, \(0.0667 \times 30 = 2\) kernels pop.
   - Total popped in the first 60 seconds = \(60 + 2 = 62\) kernels.

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate increases to **6 times** the initial rate.
   - 6 times the initial rate = \(6 \div 60 = 0.1\) kernels/second.
   - In 30 seconds, \(0.1 \times 30 = 3\) kernels pop.
   - Total popped in the first 90 seconds = \(62 + 3 = 65\) kernels.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate slows down to **half** the rate of the past 30 seconds.
   - Rate in the past 30 seconds = 0.1 kernels/second.
   - Half of that rate = \(0.1 \div 2 = 0.05\) kernels/second.

   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat.
   - Number of kernels popped in the final 30 seconds = 1.5.
   - A quarter of that = \(1.5 \div 4 = 0.375\) kernels.
   - Total popped including residual heat = \(66.5 + 0.375 = 66.875\) kernels.

Since Zahra can't have a fraction of a kernel, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Zahra has **66** pieces of popcorn to eat.",False

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is given as \(97:37\). This means for every 97 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 37 cups of water.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \(S\) represent the number of teaspoons of",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,mistralai/mistral-nemo,DeepInfra,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Sofia used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount used.

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is given as \(37:97\). This means for every 37 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 97 cups of water.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \(S\) represent the number of teaspoons of"," sugar and \(W\) represent the number of cups of water. According to the ratio, we can write:
\[
\frac{S}{W} = \frac{37}{97}
\]

### Step 3: Use the Total Amount
We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 1474 teaspoons/cups. So we can write:
\[
S + W = 1474
\]

### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations
We have a system of two equations with two variables:
\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{S}{W} = \frac{37}{97} \\
S + W = 1474
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, we can express \(S\) in terms of \(W\):
\[
S = \frac{37}{97}W
\]

Substitute this expression for \(S\) into the second equation:
\[
\frac{37}{97}W + W = 1474
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\left(\frac{37}{97} + 1\right)W = 1474
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\left(\frac{37}{97} + \frac{97}{97}\right)W = 1474
\]
\[
\frac{134}{97}W = 1474
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \(W\)
Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{134}{97}\) to solve for \(W\):
\[
W = 1474 \times \frac{97}{134}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \(W\)
\[
W = 1474 \times \frac{97}{134} \approx 1080
\]

### Step 7: Calculate \(S\)
Now that we have \(W\), we can find \(S\) using the expression we found earlier:
\[
S = \frac{37}{97} \times 1080
\]

### Step 8: Calculate \(S\)
\[
S = 37 \times 11 \approx 407

### Step 3: Determine the time spent walking on the sidewalk
Now that we know Mia's speed on the sidewalk, we can calculate the time she spends walking on the sidewalk (which is also 12 kilometers) using the formula:

\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{12 \text{ km}}{0.48 \text{ km/min}} = 25 \text{ min}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for the entire walk
Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 24-kilometer walk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 50 \text{ min} + 25 \text{ min} = 75 \text{ min}
\]

Therefore, it takes Mia 75 minutes to complete her entire 24-kilometer walk.",False

\[
2395 \text{ calories} - 1",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,mistralai/mistral-nemo,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of bread you can eat to stay within your daily calorie target, given that you have already consumed 1350 calories.

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining calories
Your daily calorie target is 2395 calories, and you have already consumed 1350 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[
2395 \text{ calories} + 1350 \text{ calories} = 3745 \text{ calories}

### Step 3: Determine how many servings you can eat
Now, we need to find out how many servings of the bread you can eat with the remaining 1045 calories. Since each serving has 475 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[
1045 \text{ calories} \div 475 \text{ calories/serving} = 2.2 \text{ servings}

The bag has 275 ounces, and there are 5 servings in the bag. So, each serving is:

\[
275 \text{ ounces} \div 5 \text{ servings} = 55 \text{ ounces/serving}

Each horse needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. First, let's find out twice the amount each alpaca needs:

\[
\text{Twice the amount per alpaca} = 2 \times 9 \, \text{kg} \\
\text{Twice the amount per alpaca} = 18 \, \text{kg}

- Fourth trout: 32 kilograms",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,mistralai/mistral-nemo,DeepInfra,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of the trouts Wei caught and then calculate the total earnings based on the cost per kilogram.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the trouts
Wei caught 4 trouts with the following weights:

- Second trout: 33 grams
- Third trout: 32 grams
- Fourth trout: 32 grams"," (not mentioned, but we'll assume it's the same as the third trout for the sake of this problem)

Total weight = 70 + 33 + 32 + 32 = 167 grams

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings
The cost per kilogram of trout is €1.0. Since the trouts are weighed in grams, we need to convert the total weight from grams to kilograms to match the currency unit.

1 kilogram = 1000 grams

Total weight in kilograms = 167 grams / 1000 = 0.167 kilograms

Total earnings = Total weight in kilograms × Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 0.167 kilograms × €1.0/kilogram = €0.167

### Final answer:
Wei will earn €0.167 after selling all the trouts to the market.",False

He then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,54,"To determine how many hours Liam spends learning each week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Learning Time
Liam has 6 regular periods plus 1 extra class each day. Each class is 60 minutes long.

\[
\text{Total periods per day} = 6 + 1 = 7 \text{ periods}
\]
\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 7 \",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,mistralai/mistral-nemo,DeepInfra,"To determine how many hours Liam spends learning each week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Learning Time
Liam has 6 regular periods plus 1 extra class each day. Each class is 60 minutes long.

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Learning Time (Monday to Friday)
Liam goes to class for 6 days a week.

\[
\text{Weekly learning time (Mon-Fri)} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 2880 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Extra Learning Time on Saturday and Sunday
Liam spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

\[
\text{Extra learning time per day (Sat-Sun)} = \frac{1}{7} \times 2880 \text{ minutes} = 411.43 \text{ minutes}
\]
Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we'll round this to the nearest whole minute. So, Liam spends approximately 411 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

### Step 4: Calculate Total Weekly Learning Time

### Step 1: Time to swim 1 mile on a cold day
We are given that Wei swims a mile in 30 minutes when the water is cold.

### Step 2: Time to swim 1 mile on a hot day
When the water is warm, Wei"," swims a mile in 5 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. So, we calculate the time for a hot day as follows:
Time on a hot day = 2 * Time on a cold day + 5 minutes

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Cost of Laser Tag:**
   - Each person (Mia and her friends) plays one round of laser tag.
   - Cost per round of laser tag = ₺15","
   - Total cost for laser tag = Number of people * ₺15

2. **Cost of Pinball Tokens:**

1. The probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 on a 4-sided die.
2. The probability that Luis rolls two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 2
A 4-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 2 and 3."," Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes (3 and 4) out of 4 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 2) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 2) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row
The odd numbers on a 4-sided die are 1 and 3. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes (1 and 3) out of 4 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{odd number}) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two odd numbers in a row}) = P(\text{odd number}) \times P(\text{odd number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 2 than to roll two odd numbers in a row. This can be expressed as the ratio of the two probabilities:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 2)}{P(\text{two odd numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 2 is 2 times more likely than rolling two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 4: Expressing the result as a percentage
To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
\[
\text{Percentage} = (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%

   - In 30 seconds, the number of kernels popped = 180 kernels.

5. **After taking the pan off the heat:**
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from residual heat.
   - Number of kernels popped in the final 30 seconds = 180.
   - A quarter of 180 = \(180 \div 4 = 45\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 240 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 360 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 180 kernels
- Residual heat: 45 kernels

Total number of kernels popped:
\[ 60 + 240 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 885 \]

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is given as \(97:37\). This means for every 97 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 37 cups of water.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \(S\) represent the number of teaspoons of",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct,DeepInfra,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Sofia used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount used.

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is given as \(37:97\). This means for every 37 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 97 cups of water.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \(S\) represent the number of teaspoons of"," sugar and \(W\) represent the number of cups of water. According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water used is 1474. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S + W = 1474 \]

### Step 3: Express the Ratio in Terms of a Variable
Since the ratio of sugar to water is \(37:97\), we can express \(S\) and \(W\) in terms of a common variable \(k\):
\[ S = 37k \]
\[ W = 97k \]

### Step 4: Substitute into the Total Equation
Substitute \(S\) and \(W\) into the total equation:
\[ 37k + 97k = 1474 \]

### Step 5: Combine Like Terms
Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 134k = 1474 \]

### Step 6: Solve for \(k\)
Divide both sides by 134 to solve for \(k\):
\[ k = \frac{1474}{134} \]
\[ k = 11 \]

### Step 7: Calculate the Number of Teaspoons of Sugar
Now that we have \(k\), we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
\[ S = 37k \]
\[ S = 37 \times 11 \]
\[ S = 407 \]

### Final Answer
Sofia used \(\boxed{407}\) teaspoons of sugar.",False

Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours of TV watched on each day, then use the total to find the number of 45-minute episodes on Thursday.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Benjamin watched a 4-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Tuesday",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 45-minute episodes Benjamin watched on Thursday. Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours of TV watched on each day, then use the total to find the number of 45-minute episodes on Thursday.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Benjamin watched a 3-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Tuesday"," and Wednesday: \(3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Thursday:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 45-minute episodes Benjamin watched.
   - Each 45-minute episode is \(0.75\) hours.
   - Total time on Thursday: \(0.75x \text{ hours}\).

3. **Friday:**
   - Benjamin watched a 6-hour episode and a 15-minute show.
   - 15 minutes is \(0.25\) hours.
   - Total for Friday: \(6 \text{ hours} + 0.25 \text{ hours} = 6.25 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Saturday:**
   - Benjamin watched two 4-hour episodes.
   - Total for Saturday: \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

5. **Total TV time for the week:**
   - Given: 23 hours.
   - Sum of TV time from Tuesday to Saturday: \(6 \text{ hours} + 0.75x \text{ hours} + 6.25 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 23 \text{ hours}\).

### Equation Setup:
\[ 6 + 0.75x + 6.25 + 8 = 23 \]

### Simplify the Equation:
\[ 20.25 + 0.75x = 23 \]

### Solve for \(x\):
\[ 0.75x = 23 - 20.25 \]
\[ 0.75x = 2.75 \]
\[ x = \frac{2.75}{0.75} \]
\[ x = 3.6667 \]

Since \(x\) must be a whole number (as you can't watch a fraction of an episode), we need to re-evaluate the problem. However, the calculation shows that \(x\) should be 3.6667, which suggests a possible rounding or interpretation issue. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that \(x\) should be a whole number, and the closest whole number is 3.

### Verification:
If \(x = 3\):
- Total time on Thursday: \(0.75 \times 3 = 2.25 \text{ hours}\).
- Total TV time for the week: \(6 + 2.25 + 6.25 + 8 = 22.5 \text{ hours}\).

This is close to 23 hours, and the slight discrepancy might be due to rounding or a minor error in the problem statement. However, the closest whole number solution is \(x = 3\).

2. **Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.**
3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.**
4. **Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct,DeepInfra,"To determine how much money Valentina will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total space occupied by the flowers Valentina does not own.**
2. **Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.**
3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.**
4. **Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total"," space occupied by the flowers Valentina does not own

Each flower occupies 3 meters of space, and there needs to be 15.5 meters between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
\[ 3 \text{ meters (flower)} + 15.5 \text{ meters (space)} = 18.5 \text{ meters} \]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining space in the flower bed

Valentina's flower bed is 217 meters long. She already owns 11 flowers. The total space occupied by these 11 flowers and the spaces between them is:
\[ 11 \times 18.5 \text{ meters} = 203.5 \text{ meters} \]

The remaining space in the flower bed is:
\[ 217 \text{ meters} - 203.5 \text{ meters} = 13.5 \text{ meters} \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy

To determine how many additional flowers can fit in the remaining 13.5 meters, we need to check if the remaining space is enough for one more flower and the space between it and the next flower:
\[ 18.5 \text{ meters} > 13.5 \text{ meters} \]

Since 13.5 meters is less than 18.5 meters, Valentina cannot fit another flower in the remaining space. Therefore, she does not need to buy any additional flowers.

### Step 4: Compute the total cost of the additional flowers

Since Valentina does not need to buy any additional flowers, the total cost is:
\[ 0 \text{ flowers} \times €14 \text{ per flower} = €0 \]

### Final Answer

Valentina will spend \(\boxed{€0}\) at the store to fill up her flower bed.",False

59,"I have 18 liters of peach drink that are 2/3 water and I wish to add it to 21 liters of grape drink that is two-thirds water. But as I pour it, I spill 3 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?",24,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 36 liters after spilling 3 liters of the peach drink.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original peach drink
The original peach drink is 18 liters, and it is \(\frac{2}{3}\) water.

\[
\text{Water in peach drink} = 18 \times \frac{2}{3} =",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 36 liters after spilling 3 liters of the peach drink.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original peach drink
The original peach drink is 18 liters, and it is \(\frac{3}{2}\) water.

\[
\text{Water in peach drink} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} ="," 18 \times 0.6667 = 12 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original grape drink
The original grape drink is 21 liters, and it is \(\frac{2}{3}\) water.

\[
\text{Water in grape drink} = 21 \times \frac{2}{3} = 21 \times 0.6667 = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of water in the spilled peach drink
We spill 3 liters of the peach drink. Since the peach drink is \(\frac{2}{3}\) water:

\[
\text{Water in spilled peach drink} = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 0.6667 = 2 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of water in the remaining peach drink
The remaining peach drink is \(18 - 3 = 15\) liters. The amount of water in the remaining peach drink is:

\[
\text{Water in remaining peach drink} = 15 \times \frac{2}{3} = 15 \times 0.6667 = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water in the final mixture
The final mixture is the sum of the water in the remaining peach drink and the water in the grape drink:

\[
\text{Total water} = \text{Water in remaining peach drink} + \text{Water in grape drink} = 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ liters}

If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 8 hours if she spends one-half of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking?",18,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Keisha's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in 8 hours by spending half the time running and half the time walking.

### Step 1: Determine Keisha's Running Speed

We are given that Keisha can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her running speed. Let \( r \)",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Keisha's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in 8 hours by spending half the time running and half the time walking.

### Step 1: Determine Keisha's Running Speed

We are given that Keisha can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is \( \frac{4}{3} \) of her running speed. Let \( r \)"," be her running speed in miles per hour. Then:

\[
\text{Skipping speed} = \frac{3}{4} \times r = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Solving for \( r \):

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times r = 3
\]

\[
r = 3 \times \frac{4}{3} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, Keisha's running speed is 4 miles per hour.

### Step 2: Determine Keisha's Walking Speed

We are given that Keisha can run eight times faster than she can walk. Let \( w \) be her walking speed in miles per hour. Then:

\[
r = 8w
\]

Since \( r = 4 \) miles per hour:

\[
4 = 8w
\]

\[
w = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, Keisha's walking speed is 0.5 miles per hour.

### Step 3: Calculate the Distance Traveled in 8 Hours

Keisha spends half of the 8 hours running and the other half walking. Therefore, she spends 4 hours running and 4 hours walking.

- **Distance traveled while running:**

\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
\]

- **Distance traveled while walking:**

\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 0.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Distance Traveled

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 16 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Keisha can travel a total of \(\boxed{18}\) miles in 8 hours if she spends half the time running and half the time walking.",True

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{42}{210} \right) \times 100\% \]

First, simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{42}{210} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Then, calculate the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \]

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]

### Explanation
1. **Unit Conversion:** Ensured all measurements are in the same unit (feet).

### Given:
- The fog bank covers 77 miles in 50 minutes.

### Question:
- How many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, which is also 77 miles across?

### Reasoning:
Since the fog bank covers 77 miles",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire 77-mile distance of the city.

### Given:
- The fog bank covers 70 miles in 50 minutes.

### Question:
- How many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, which is also 77 miles across?

### Reasoning:
Since the fog bank covers 70 miles"," in 50 minutes, we can calculate the speed at which the fog bank is moving and then use that speed to find out how long it takes to cover 77 miles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the speed of the fog bank:**
   - Speed = Distance / Time
   - Here, Distance = 70 miles and Time = 50 minutes
   - Speed = 70 miles / 50 minutes = 1.4 miles per minute

2. **Determine the time to cover 77 miles:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Distance = 77 miles
   - Speed = 1.4 miles per minute
   - Time = 77 miles / 1.4 miles per minute

3. **Perform the division:**
   - 77 ÷ 1.4
   - To make the division easier, multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal:
     - 770 ÷ 14

4. **Calculate 770 ÷ 14:**
   - 14 × 55 = 770
   - Therefore, 770 ÷ 14 = 55

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{55} \]

So, it will take 55 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

### Verification:
- Check the units: miles and minutes are consistent.
- Verify the division: 77 ÷ 1.4 indeed equals 55.
- Ensure the speed calculation is correct: 70 miles in 50 minutes is indeed 1.4 miles per minute.

Everything checks out, confirming that 55 minutes is the correct answer.",False

1. The probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 on a 4-sided die.
2. The probability that Luis rolls two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 2
A 4-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 3 and",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine two probabilities:

1. The probability that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 on a 4-sided die.
2. The probability that Luis rolls two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 2
A 4-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 2 and 3."," Wait, no, 2 is not greater than 2; it's equal to 2. So, the numbers greater than 2 are 3 and 4.

So, there are 2 favorable outcomes (3 and 4) out of 4 possible outcomes.

Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row
First, identify the odd numbers on a 4-sided die. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the odd numbers are 1 and 3.

Probability of rolling an odd number on one roll = number of odd numbers / total numbers = 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

So, probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

### Step 3: Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 2 than to roll two odd numbers in a row
We need to find the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage.

First, find the difference in probabilities:

50% - 25% = 25%

Now, express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row.

So, (difference / probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row) * 100%

= (25% / 25%) * 100% = 100%

Therefore, it is 100% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is given as \(97:37\). This means for every 97 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 37 cups of water.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \(S\) represent the number of teaspoons of",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Sofia used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount used.

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is given as \(37:97\). This means for every 37 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 97 cups of water.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \(S\) represent the number of teaspoons of"," sugar, and \(W\) represent the number of cups of water. According to the ratio:
\[
\frac{S}{W} = \frac{37}{97}
\]

### Step 3: Express One Variable in Terms of the Other
From the ratio, we can express \(S\) in terms of \(W\):
\[
S = \frac{37}{97} W
\]

### Step 4: Total Amount Used
The total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 1474. Therefore:
\[
S + W = 1474
\]

### Step 5: Substitute the Expression for \(S\)
Substitute \(S = \frac{37}{97} W\) into the total amount equation:
\[
\frac{37}{97} W + W = 1474
\]

### Step 6: Combine Like Terms
Combine the terms on the left side:
\[
\left( \frac{37}{97} + 1 \right) W = 1474
\]
\[
\left( \frac{37 + 97}{97} \right) W = 1474
\]
\[
\frac{134}{97} W = 1474
\]

### Step 7: Solve for \(W\)
Multiply both sides by 97 to eliminate the denominator:
\[
134 W = 1474 \times 97
\]

Calculate \(1474 \times 97\):
\[
1474 \times 97 = 1474 \times 100 - 1474 \times 3 = 147400 - 4422 = 142978
\]
So,
\[
134 W = 142978
\]

Now, divide both sides by 134:
\[
W = \frac{142978}{134}
\]

Calculate the division:
\[
142978 \div 134 = 1067
\]
So,
\[
W = 1067
\]

### Step 8: Find \(S\)
Now, substitute \(W = 1067\) back into the expression for \(S\):
\[
S = \frac{37}{97} \times 1067
\]

Calculate \(\frac{37}{97} \times 1067\):
First, simplify \(\frac{37}{97}\):
\[
\frac{37}{97} = \frac{37}{97}
\]
Now, multiply by 1067:
\[
S = \frac{37 \times 1067}{97}
\]

Calculate \(37 \times 1067\):
\[
37 \times 1000 = 37000
\]
\[
37 \times 67 = 2479
\]
\[
37000 + 2479 = 39479
\]
So,
\[
S = \frac{39479}{97}
\]

Now, divide 39479 by 97:
\[
39479 \div 97 = 407
\]
So,
\[
S = 407

The total weight of all the feed is 1755 kg.

Next, we need to determine how many trips the farmer's truck needs to make to carry this total weight, given that the truck can carry 180 kg at a time.

- Number of trips = total weight / capacity per trip
- Number of trips = 1755 / 180

Let's perform the division:

- 180 × 9 = 1620 kg

Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours of TV watched on each day, then use the total to find the number of 45-minute episodes on Thursday.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Benjamin watched a 3-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Tuesday"," and Wednesday: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hours.

2. **Thursday:**
   - He watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show.
   - Let’s denote the number of 45-minute episodes on Thursday as \(x\).
   - Since 45 minutes is \( \frac{45}{60} = 0.75\) hours, the total time on Thursday is \(0.75x\) hours.

3. **Friday:**
   - He watched a 6-hour episode and a 15-minute show.
   - First, convert 15 minutes to hours: \( \frac{15}{60} = 0.25\) hours.
   - Total for Friday: \(6 + 0.25 = 6.25\) hours.

   - He watched two 4-hour episodes.
   - Total for Saturday: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

5. **Total TV watched in all:**
   - According to the problem, the total is 23 hours.

### Setting Up the Equation:

Now, let's sum up the TV hours from all days and set them equal to 23 hours.

\[
\text{Tuesday and Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday} + \text{Saturday} = 23
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
6 + 0.75x + 6.25 + 8 = 23
\]

### Solving for \(x\):

First, combine the constant terms:

\[
6 + 6.25 + 8 = 20.25
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
20.25 + 0.75x = 23
\]

Subtract 20.25 from both sides:

\[
0.75x = 23 - 20.25
\]

\[
0.75x = 2.75
\]

Now, solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{2.75}{0.75} = 3.\overline{6}
\]

Wait, this result is not a whole number, which doesn't make sense because the number of episodes should be an integer.

### Rechecking the Problem:

I need to verify the problem statement again because there might be a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation.

Upon re-reading:

- On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 4-hour episode each night, not 3 hours.

- On Friday, he watched a 6-hour episode and a 15-minute show.

- On Saturday, he watched two 4-hour episodes.

2. **Thursday:**
   - \(x\) episodes of 45 minutes each.
   - Total: \(0.75x\) hours.

3. **Friday:**
   - 6 hours + 15 minutes.
   - 15 minutes is 0.25 hours.
   - Total: \(6 + 0.25 = 6.25\) hours.

4. **Saturday:**
   - Two 4-hour episodes.
   - Total: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

5. **Total TV watched:**
   - 23 hours.

### Corrected Equation:

\[
8 + 0.75x + 6.25 + 8 = 23
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
8 + 6.25 + 8 = 22.25
\]

So:

\[
22.25 + 0.75x = 23
\]

Subtract 22.25 from both sides:

\[
0.75x = 0.75

Solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{0.75}{0.75} = 1

22,"Emma was preparing for a game night at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a package of 18 new spoons and gave them to Emma. While Emma was making the stuffed peppers, she used ten of the spoons to sample her stuffed peppers.

1. **Initial Situation**: Emma bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many were in it yet. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Emma bought as \( x \).

2. **Husband's Contribution**: Emma's husband bought a package of 8 new spoons and gave them to Emma. So, after receiving these spoons,"," Emma had her original \( x \) spoons plus 18 more.

3. **Using Some Spoons**: While making the stuffed peppers, Emma used 10 spoons to sample her dish. So, from the total she had after receiving her husband's spoons, she subtracted 10 spoons.

4. **Final Count**: When Emma went to set the table, she had 30 spoons left.

Now, let's translate these steps into an equation:

- Start with \( x \) spoons (from Emma's purchase).

- Add 18 spoons from her husband: \( x + 18 \).

- Subtract the 10 spoons she used: \( (x + 18) - 10 \).

- This equals the 30 spoons she had left: \( (x + 18) - 10 = 30 \).

Now, simplify the equation:

\( x + 18 - 10 = 30 \)

\( x + 8 = 30 \)

Now, solve for \( x \):

\( x = 30 - 8 \)

\( x = 22 \)

So, the package that Emma bought contained 22 spoons.

4. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks.**

### Step 1: Initial Occupied and Unoccupied Rooms
- The clinic",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of occupied and unoccupied rooms.**
2. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.**
3. **Determine the total number of occupied rooms after 2 weeks.**
4. **Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks.**

### Step 1: Initial Occupied and Unoccupied Rooms
- The clinic"," has a total capacity of 1800 rooms.
- Initially, 1/4 of the rooms are occupied.

First, calculate the number of initially occupied rooms:
\[
\text{Initial occupied rooms} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1800 = 450 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, calculate the number of initially unoccupied rooms:
\[
\text{Initial unoccupied rooms} = 1800 - 450 = 1350 \text{ rooms}

### Step 2: Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks
- 40 patients are admitted each day.
- We need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.

   - Pavel's current age is 13, so 2 times his current age is \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \)."," So, in 3 years, Valentina will be 26 years old.

3. **Valentina's Current Age**: To find Valentina's current age, we need to subtract 3 years from her age in 3 years.
   - If Valentina will be 26 in 3 years, then her current age is \( 26 - 3 = 23 \) years old.

Wait a minute, let's double-check that.

Actually, the problem says ""In 3 years his sister Valentina will be 3 times as old as Pavel is now."" Wait, in the initial step, I mistakenly wrote ""2 times"" instead of ""3 times."" Let's correct that.

1. Pavel is 13 years old.

2. In 3 years, Valentina will be 3 times as old as Pavel is now.

   - So, 3 times Pavel's current age is \( 3 \times 13 = 39 \). Therefore, in 3 years, Valentina will be 39 years old.

3. To find Valentina's current age, subtract 3 years from her age in 3 years.

   - \( 39 - 3 = 36 \) years old.

So, Valentina is currently 36 years old.

But let's make sure this makes sense.

If Pavel is 13 now, in 3 years he will be \( 13 + 3 = 16 \) years old.

At that time, Valentina will be 39 years old, which is indeed 3 times Pavel's current age (13 years).

Wait, but the problem says ""3 times as old as Pavel is now,"" not ""3 times as old as Pavel will be in 3 years.""

So, according to the problem, in 3 years, Valentina's age will be 3 times Pavel's current age.

So, in 3 years:

- Pavel's current age is 13.

- Valentina's age in 3 years is \( 3 \times 13 = 39 \).

- Therefore, Valentina's current age is \( 39 - 3 = 36 \) years old.

This seems correct.

Alternatively, we can set up an equation to solve for Valentina's current age.

Let \( V \) be Valentina's current age.

In 3 years, Valentina's age will be \( V + 3 \).

According to the problem, \( V + 3 = 3 \times 13 \).

So, \( V + 3 = 39 \).

Subtract 3 from both sides: \( V = 39 - 3 = 36 \).

Therefore, Valentina is currently 36 years old.

   - So, the total cost of the washers is ₣22.25.

3. **Subtract the total cost from Yusuf's initial amount:**
   - Yusuf initially has ₣102.50.
   - Subtract the total cost of the washers from this amount:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected so far.
Daphne has 35 signatures, and Uma has 30 signatures. The total number of signatures collected so far is:
\[ 35 + 30 = 65 \text{",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many signatures Daphne and Uma need to collect in the remaining 2 weeks to reach their goal of 120 signatures between them.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected so far.
Daphne has 35 signatures, and Uma has 30 signatures. The total number of signatures collected so far is:
\[ 35 - 30 = 5 \]"," 
Wait, that doesn't make sense. It should be:
\[ 35 + 30 = 65 \]
So, they have 65 signatures in total currently.

### Step 2: Determine the goal.
Their goal is to have 120 signatures combined by the end of the winter break.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of signatures needed to reach the goal.
To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]
So, they need to collect 55 more signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{55} \]

### Additional Thoughts
It's important to note that the problem doesn't specify how many signatures they collect per week or any constraints on how many signatures they can collect in the remaining weeks. It simply asks for the total number of additional signatures needed to reach their goal. Therefore, the answer is straightforward: they need to collect 55 more signatures in total over the next 2 weeks.

However, if we wanted to find out how many signatures they need to collect per week on average to reach their goal, we could divide the total needed signatures by the number of weeks left:
\[ \frac{55}{2} = 27.5 \]
Since they can't collect half a signature, they would need to collect at least 28 signatures per week, assuming they can collect whole signatures only. But the problem doesn't ask for this, so it's unnecessary for the final answer.

Also, it's worth verifying the initial calculation to ensure there were no mistakes. Daphne has 35 signatures, Uma has 30, so together they have 65. Their goal is 120, so 120 minus 65 is indeed 55. Therefore, the answer is correct.

\[
\text{Number of",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of caterpillars and then find the total number of insects in the garden.

### Step 1: Determine the number of caterpillars
The problem states that Bodhi found \( \frac{5}{3} \) as many caterpillars as grasshoppers. Given that there are 25 grasshoppers, we can calculate the number of caterpillars as follows:

\[
\text{Number of"," caterpillars} = \frac{5}{3} \times \text{Number of grasshoppers}
\]

\[
\text{Number of caterpillars} = \frac{5}{3} \times 25
\]

First, perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{5}{3} \times 25 = \frac{5 \times 25}{3} = \frac{125}{3}

Now, divide 125 by 3:

\[
125 \div 3 = 41.\overline{6}

So, the number of caterpillars is approximately 41.67. However, since the number of insects should be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

### Step 2: Re-evaluate the problem statement
Upon re-reading the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says ""3/5 as many caterpillars as grasshoppers,"" not ""5/3."" Let's correct that.

### Step 3: Correct the calculation
The correct interpretation should be:

\[
\text{Number of caterpillars} = \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Number of grasshoppers}
\]

\[
\text{Number of caterpillars} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = \frac{3 \times 25}{5} = \frac{75}{5} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 caterpillars.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of insects
Now, we need to find the total number of insects, which includes both grasshoppers and caterpillars.

\[
\text{Total insects} = \text{Number of grasshoppers} + \text{Number of caterpillars}
\]

\[
\text{Total insects} = 25 + 15 = 40

1. **Calculate the total space occupied by the flowers Valentina already owns.**
2. **Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.**
3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.**
4. **Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To determine how much money Valentina will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total space occupied by the flowers Valentina does not own.**
2. **Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.**
3. **Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.**
4. **Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total"," space occupied by the flowers Valentina does not own.

Valentina already owns 11 flowers. Each flower occupies 3 meters of space, and there needs to be 15.5 meters between each plant.

First, calculate the space occupied by one flower including the space between flowers:

\[
\text{Space per flower} = \text{width of flower} + \text{space between flowers} = 3 \, \text{m} + 15.5 \, \text{m} = 18.5 \, \text{m}
\]

However, the last flower does not need space after it, so we need to adjust the calculation for the total space occupied by multiple flowers.

For \( n \) flowers, the total space occupied is:

\[
\text{Total space} = (\text{number of flowers} \times \text{width of flower}) + (\text{number of spaces between flowers} \times \text{space between flowers})
\]

The number of spaces between flowers is \( n - 1 \).

So,

\[
\text{Total space} = (n \times 3) + ((n - 1) \times 15.5)
\]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining space in the flower bed.

The flower bed is 217 meters long. The remaining space is:

\[
\text{Remaining space} = \text{total length of flower bed} - \text{total space occupied by existing flowers}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many additional flowers Valentina needs to buy.

Using the remaining space, calculate how many additional flowers can be planted, considering the space each additional flower requires.

### Step 4: Compute the total cost of the additional flowers.

Each additional flower costs €14. Multiply the number of additional flowers by the cost per flower.

Let's proceed with the calculations.

First, calculate the total space occupied by the 11 flowers Valentina already owns.

\[
\text{Total space for 11 flowers} = (11 \times 3) + ((11 - 1) \times 15.5) = 33 + (10 \times 15.5) = 33 + 155 = 188 \, \text{m}
\]

Now, calculate the remaining space in the flower bed.

\[
\text{Remaining space} = 217 \, \text{m} - 188 \, \text{m} = 29 \, \text{m}
\]

Next, determine how many additional flowers can be planted in the remaining 29 meters.

Each additional flower requires:

\[
\text{Space per additional flower} = 3 \, \text{m} + 15.5 \, \text{m} = 18.5 \, \text{m}
\]

However, this approach might not be accurate because the last flower might not require the full 15.5 meters after it.

Instead, let's model the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the number of additional flowers needed.

The total space required for \( x \) additional flowers is:

\[
\text{Total space for additional flowers} = (x \times 3) + ((x - 1) \times 15.5)
\]

This space must be less than or equal to the remaining 29 meters.

So,

\[
(x \times 3) + ((x - 1) \times 15.5) \leq 29
\]

Simplify the inequality:

\[
3x + 15.5(x - 1) \leq 29
\]

\[
3x + 15.5x - 15.5 \leq 29
\]

\[
18.5x - 15.5 \leq 29
\]

\[
18.5x \leq 44.5
\]

\[
x \leq \frac{44.5}{18.5} \approx 2.405
\]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the maximum number of additional flowers Valentina can plant is 2.

Now, calculate the total cost for these 2 additional flowers.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \, \text{€}
\]

Therefore, Valentina will spend 28 euros at the store to fill up her flower bed.

1. **Total eggs hidden by Umar:**
   - Umar hid 6 dozen eggs.
   - Since 1 dozen = 10 eggs, 6 dozen = 6 × 10 = 60 eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Quinn:**
   - Quinn finds 12 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Isabella:**
   - Isabella finds two"," times as many as Quinn.
   - So, Isabella finds 2 × 12 = 24 eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Mia:**
   - Mia finds 4 less than Isabella.
   - So, Mia finds 24 - 4 = 20 eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Nia:**
   - Nia finds a quarter as many as Mia.
   - So, Nia finds 20 / 4 = 5 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all:

- Quinn: 12 eggs
- Isabella: 24 eggs
- Mia: 20 eggs
- Nia: 5 eggs

Total found = 12 + 24 + 20 + 5 = 61 eggs.

Wait a minute, Umar only hid 60 eggs, but the total found is 61 eggs. That doesn't make sense because they can't find more eggs than were hidden.

Let me double-check the calculations.

First,确认一下鸡蛋的总数:

- 6 dozen eggs, and 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, not 10. So, 6 × 12 = 72 eggs.

Oh, that's a mistake. I thought 1 dozen was 10 eggs, but it's actually 12.

So, correcting that:

- Total eggs hidden: 6 × 12 = 72 eggs.

Now, let's recalculate based on this correct total.

- Quinn finds 12 eggs.
- Isabella finds two times as many as Quinn: 2 × 12 = 24 eggs.
- Mia finds 4 less than Isabella: 24 - 4 = 20 eggs.
- Nia finds a quarter as many as Mia: 20 / 4 = 5 eggs.

Total eggs found: 12 + 24 + 20 + 5 = 61 eggs.

Now, subtract the total found from the total hidden to find out how many are still hidden:

72 - 61 = 11 eggs.

So, there are 11 eggs still hidden in the yard.

4. **Calculate the total number of collections Umar makes in a week.**
5. **Compute the total amount of money Umar",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To determine how much money Umar makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.**
2. **Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.**
3. **Find the total number of apartments Umar collects garbage from.**
4. **Calculate the total number of collections Umar makes in a day.**
5. **Compute the total amount of money Umar"," earns per day.**
6. **Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days he works in a week to get the weekly earnings.**

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.

Each of the first two complexes has 450 apartments.

\[
\text{Total apartments in first two complexes} = 450 \times 2 = 900
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.

The third complex is 20% bigger than the other two combined.

First, find 20% of the total apartments in the first two complexes.

\[
20\% \text{ of } 900 = 0.20 \times 900 = 180
\]

Now, add this to the total of the first two complexes to get the number of apartments in the third complex.

\[
\text{Apartments in third complex} = 900 + 180 = 1080
\]

### Step 3: Find the total number of apartments Umar collects garbage from.

Add the apartments from all three complexes.

\[
\text{Total apartments} = 450 + 450 + 1080 = 1980
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections Umar makes in a day.

Umar collects garbage 2 times a week from each place.

Since there are three complexes, and he collects from each twice a week:

\[
\text{Total collections per week} = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

However, to find the daily collections, we need to know how many days a week he works. Assuming he works every day of the week, then:

\[
\text{Collections per day} = \frac{6}{7} \approx 0.857 \text{ collections per day}
\]

But this seems incorrect because the problem states ""2 times a week from each place."" It's more likely that he collects from all three complexes on two specific days of the week. Therefore, on those two days, he collects from all three complexes once each day.

So, on each collection day, he collects from 3 complexes.

Thus, per collection day, he makes 3 collections.

Given that he works 2 collection days a week:

\[
\text{Total collections per week} = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

But for daily collections, if he works only on those two days, then on the other 5 days, he doesn't collect any garbage.

Therefore, it's better to consider his collections on the days he works.

### Step 5: Compute the total amount of money Umar earns per day.

First, find out how much he earns per collection.

He gets paid ₣0.45 per collection per apartment.

So, for one collection from one complex, he earns:

\[
\text{Earnings per collection} = \text{number of apartments} \times \text{payment per apartment}
\]

But since he collects from multiple complexes in a day, we need to calculate the total earnings per collection day.

On each collection day, he collects from 3 complexes.

Total apartments per collection day:

\[
\text{Total apartments per collection day} = 450 + 450 + 1080 = 1980
\]

Earnings per collection day:

\[
\text{Earnings per collection day} = 1980 \times 0.45 = 891
\]

Since he works 2 collection days a week:

\[
\text{Weekly earnings} = 891 \times 2 = 1782
\]

Therefore, Umar makes ₣1782 in a week.

How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?",24,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 36 liters after spilling 3 liters of the peach drink.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original peach drink
The original peach drink is 18 liters, and it is \(\frac{2}{3}\) water.

\[
\text{Water in peach drink} = 18 \times \frac{2}{3} =",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 36 liters after spilling 3 liters of the peach drink.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original peach drink
The original peach drink is 18 liters, and it is \(\frac{3}{2}\) water.

\[
\text{Water in peach drink} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} ="," 27 \text{ liters}
\]

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the fraction \(\frac{3}{2}\) is greater than 1, which would imply more water than the total drink, which is impossible. Let's check the problem again.

Actually, the problem says the peach drink is \(\frac{2}{3}\) water.

\[
\text{Water in peach drink} = 18 \times \frac{2}{3} = 12 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the grape drink
The grape drink is 21 liters, and it is two-thirds water.

\[
\text{Water in grape drink} = 21 \times \frac{2}{3} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 3: Account for the spillage of the peach drink
3 liters of the peach drink are spilled. Since the peach drink is \(\frac{2}{3}\) water, the amount of water spilled is:

\[
\text{Water spilled} = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining amounts
- Remaining peach drink: \(18 - 3 = 15\) liters
- Remaining water in peach drink: \(12 - 2 = 10\) liters

### Step 5: Calculate the total water in the mixture
The total water will be the sum of the remaining water in the peach drink and the water in the grape drink.

\[
\text{Total water} = 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 6: Verify the total volume
The problem states that the remaining mixture is 36 liters. Let's verify this:

- Remaining peach drink: 15 liters
- Grape drink: 21 liters
- Total: \(15 + 21 = 36\) liters

This matches the given total.

First, calculate the total hours San",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To determine how much money Sanjay made in June, we need to calculate his earnings from both his hourly wage and his weekly bonus. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### 1. Calculate Sanjay's Weekly Earnings from Hourly Wage
- **Hours per day:** 7 hours
- **Days per week:** 3 days
- **Hourly rate:** ₺10 per hour

First, calculate the total hours San","jay works in a week:
\[
\text{Total hours per week} = 7 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days/week} = 21 \, \text{hours/week}
\]

Next, calculate his weekly earnings from hourly wage:
\[
\text{Weekly wage} = 21 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{₺/hour} = 210 \, \text{₺/week}
\]

### 2. Calculate Sanjay's Weekly Bonus
- **Weekly bonus:** ₺582

Since the company performed very well for the entire month, Sanjay receives this bonus each week.

### 3. Calculate Total Weekly Earnings
Add the weekly wage and the weekly bonus:
\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = 210 \, \text{₺/week} + 582 \, \text{₺/week} = 792 \, \text{₺/week}

### 4. Determine the Number of Weeks in June
June has 30 days. Assuming a standard 7-day week, the number of weeks in June is:
\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \left\lfloor \frac{30}{7} \right\rfloor = 4 \, \text{full weeks} \quad \text{(with 2 extra days)}
\]

However, since Sanjay works only 3 days a week, and the problem states that the company performed very well for the whole month, we can assume he received the full weekly bonus for each week in June.

### 5. Calculate Total Earnings for June
Multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in June:
\[
\text{Total earnings for June} = 792 \, \text{₺/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3,168 \, \text{₺}

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{3168} \]

### Explanation
- Sanjay earns ₺10 per hour for 21 hours a week, resulting in a weekly wage of ₺210.
- He receives a weekly bonus of ₺582 for the company's good performance.
- Therefore, his total weekly earnings are ₺792.
- With 4 full weeks in June, his total earnings for the month are ₺3,168.

**Note:** If June had additional days beyond the full weeks, and Sanjay worked those days, we would need to calculate earnings for those extra days. However, since the problem specifies that the company performed very well for the whole month and does not mention any partial weeks or additional days, we can assume that the 4-week calculation is sufficient.",False

   So, \( \frac{3}{4} \times 62 = 3 \times 15.5 = 46.5 \)
   Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't have half a pebble. Let me check my calculation again.
   Actually, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 62 should be calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 62 = \frac{3 \times 62}{4} = \frac{186}{4} = 46.5

1. **Uncle's Age When He Saw the Comet:**
   - Diego's uncle saw the comet when he was 46 years old.

2. **Comet's Orbit:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years.

3. **Diego's Second Sighting:**
   - Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Uncle's Age When He Saw the Comet:**
   - Diego's uncle saw the comet when he was 46 years old.

2. **Comet's Orbit:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 50 years.

3. **Diego's Second Sighting:**
   - Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times"," the age his uncle was when he saw it.

First, let's clarify the timeline:

- Let’s denote the year when Diego's uncle saw the comet as year \( t \).

- At that time, Diego's uncle was 46 years old.

- The comet returns every 50 years, so the next time it would be visible is in year \( t + 50 \).

Now, according to the problem:

- Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw it.

- His uncle was 46 when he saw it, so two times that is \( 2 \times 46 = 92 \) years old.

- Therefore, Diego was 92 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, in year \( t + 50 \).

Now, we need to find out how old Diego was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let’s denote:

- \( d \) = Diego's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

- The year when Diego saw the comet for the first time is \( t + k \times 50 \), where \( k \) is the number of orbits between the first and second sighting.

But wait, this seems a bit complicated. Let's think differently.

Since the comet orbits every 50 years, the time between successive sightings is 50 years.

Diego saw it twice: first time at age \( d \), and second time at age \( d + 50 \).

But we know that the second time he saw it, he was 92 years old.

So:

\( d + 50 = 92 \)

Therefore:

\( d = 92 - 50 = 42 \)

Wait, but that seems straightforward. Is that all there is to it?

Let me double-check.

- Uncle saw the comet at age 46, in year \( t \).

- Comet returns every 50 years, so next sighting is in year \( t + 50 \).

- Diego saw it twice: first at age \( d \), and second at age \( d + 50 = 92 \).

- Therefore, \( d = 92 - 50 = 42 \).

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's a relationship between Diego's age and his uncle's age that I need to consider.

Let’s think about the relationship between Diego and his uncle.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the age difference between Diego and his uncle. Maybe I need to find that.

Let’s see:

- Uncle was 46 when he saw the comet in year \( t \).

- Diego saw the comet for the second time in year \( t + 50 \), at age 92.

- So, in year \( t + 50 \), Diego is 92.

- Therefore, in year \( t \), Diego was \( 92 - 50 = 42 \) years old.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this.

Let’s consider the time between the uncle's sighting and Diego's second sighting.

- Uncle saw it in year \( t \), when he was 46.

- Diego saw it second time in year \( t + 50 \), when he was 92.

- So, the time between the uncle's sighting and Diego's second sighting is 50 years.

But, during these 50 years, both uncle and Diego aged 50 years.

- Uncle was 46 in year \( t \), so in year \( t + 50 \), he would be \( 46 + 50 = 96 \) years old.

- Diego was 42 in year \( t \), and 92 in year \( t + 50 \), which matches, since \( 42 + 50 = 92 \).

Wait, that doesn't make sense. \( 42 + 50 = 92 \)? That would mean \( 42 + 50 = 92 \), which is not correct mathematically. That should be \( 42 + 50 = 92 \), but that's actually correct. Wait, no, \( 42 + 50 = 92 \) is incorrect. It should be \( 42 + 50 = 92 \), but that's not right. Wait, 42 plus 50 is 92? Wait, no, that's not right. 42 plus 50 is 92... Wait, yes, it is correct. 42 + 50 does equal 92. Silly me.

So, yes, Diego was 42 in year \( t \), and 92 in year \( t + 50 \).

Therefore, Diego was 42 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Wait, but the problem says ""Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet."" His uncle was 46, so two times that is 92, which matches the second sighting.

Therefore, Diego was 42 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

But perhaps there is more to it. Maybe the first sighting was not in the same year as the uncle's sighting.

Let me think again.

- Uncle saw the comet in year \( t \), when he was 46.

- Comet returns every 50 years, so next sighting is in year \( t + 50 \).

- Diego saw it twice: first at age \( d \), and second at age \( d + 50 = 92 \).

- Therefore, \( d = 92 - 50 = 42 \).

- So, Diego was 42 years old when he saw the comet for the first time, in year \( t \), and then again at age 92 in year \( t + 50 \).

But, was Diego alive in year \( t \) to see the comet at age 42?

Well, according to this, yes.

Alternatively, maybe the first sighting was at a different orbit.

Wait, the problem says ""Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet.""

- Uncle saw it at age 46.

- Diego saw it a second time at age 92.

- Therefore, the time between Diego's first and second sighting is 50 years, since the comet orbits every 50 years.

- So, first sighting was at age 42, second at age 92.

But, is there any other information given that could affect this conclusion?

The problem mentions that the comet orbits every 50 years, but in the initial statement, it says ""Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 75 years."" Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Looking back at the problem:

<problem>

Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 75 years. Diego's uncle saw the comet when he was 46 years old. Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet. How old was Diego when he saw the comet for the first time?

</problem>

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, I mistakenly used 50 years as the orbit period, but the problem states it's every 75 years.

I must correct that.

So, the comet orbits every 75 years, not 50.

Let me redo the calculations.

1. Uncle saw the comet when he was 46 years old, in year \( t \).

2. Comet returns every 75 years, so next sighting is in year \( t + 75 \).

3. Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw it, which is \( 2 \times 46 = 92 \) years old.

Therefore, in year \( t + 75 \), Diego was 92 years old.

Let’s denote:

- In year \( t + 75 \), Diego is 92 years old.

- Therefore, in year \( t \), Diego was \( 92 - 75 = 17 \) years old.

So, Diego saw the comet for the first time at age 17, and for the second time at age 92, 75 years later.

Wait, but the problem says ""Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the comet."" Which we've interpreted correctly as age 92.

But according to this, Diego was 17 when he saw it the first time.

But let's verify if this makes sense.

- Uncle saw it at age 46 in year \( t \).

- Comet returns in year \( t + 75 \).

- In year \( t + 75 \), uncle would be \( 46 + 75 = 121 \) years old.

- Diego was 17 in year \( t \), so in year \( t + 75 \), he would be \( 17 + 75 = 92 \) years old, which matches the second sighting.

Therefore, Diego was 17 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

But the problem is about Comet Hyakutake, which has a 75-year orbit, not 50.

So, the correct answer should be that Diego was 17 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Wait a minute, but in my initial calculation, I had Diego being 17 in year \( t \), and 92 in year \( t + 75 \), which is correct.

But perhaps there is more to consider.

Is there any information about how old Diego was relative to his uncle, or any other details that could affect this?

The problem doesn't provide any information about the age difference between Diego and his uncle, so based on the given information, this seems to be the correct conclusion.

Therefore, Diego was 17 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

- Fourth trout: 32 grams","

Wait a minute, the problem mentions that the first trout weighs 70 kilograms, the second weighs 33 kilograms, and the last trout weighs 32 kilograms. But it says he caught 4 trouts. So, perhaps the third and fourth trouts both weigh 32 kilograms.

Let's confirm the weights:
- Trout 1: 70 kg
- Trout 2: 33 kg

78,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Liam has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,54,"To determine how many hours Liam spends learning each week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Learning Time
Liam has 6 regular periods plus 1 extra class each day. Each class is 60 minutes long.

\[
\text{Total periods per day} = 6 + 1 = 7 \text{ periods}
\]
\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 7 \",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To determine how many hours Liam spends learning each week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Learning Time
Liam has 6 regular periods plus 1 extra class each day. Each class is 60 minutes long.

\[
\text{Total periods per day} = 6 + 1 = 8 \text{ periods}
\]
\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 8 \","times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Learning Time (Monday to Friday)
Liam goes to class for 6 days a week, but the problem mentions ""6 days a week,"" which might be a typo because it's common to have school from Monday to Friday (5 days) plus possibly Saturday. However, to align with the problem, we'll assume he attends classes for 6 days.

\[
\text{Minutes per week (6 days)} = 480 \times 6 = 2880 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Extra Learning Time on Saturday and Sunday
He spends \(\frac{1}{7}\) of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

First, find \(\frac{1}{7}\) of his weekly minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{7} \times 2880 \approx 411.4286 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since he spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday:

\[
\text{Extra minutes per weekend day} = 411.4286 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Total extra minutes per weekend} = 411.4286 \times 2 \approx 822.8571 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Weekly Learning Time
Add the weekly learning time (Monday to Saturday) and the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.

\[
\text{Total weekly minutes} = 2880 + 822.8571 \approx 3702.8571 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Convert Total Weekly Minutes to Hours
There are 60 minutes in an hour.

\[
\text{Total weekly hours} = \frac{3702.8571}{60} \approx 61.7143 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{61.7143} \]

### Explanation
1. **Daily Learning Time**: Calculated by multiplying the number of periods per day by the duration of each period.
2. **Weekly Learning Time (6 days)**: Multiplied the daily learning time by 6.
3. **Extra Learning Time**: Calculated \(\frac{1}{7}\) of the weekly minutes and then doubled it for Saturday and Sunday.
4. **Total Weekly Learning Time**: Summed the regular weekly minutes and the extra weekend minutes.
5. **Conversion to Hours**: Divided the total minutes by 60 to get hours.

This method ensures that all parts of Liam's learning schedule are accounted for, providing an accurate total of his weekly learning hours.",False

   - Amelia has half as many LinkedIn friends as Zahra, so Amelia's number of friends is \( \frac{1}{2}Z \).
   - Mei has ten times as many friends on LinkedIn as Zahra, so Mei's number of friends is \( 10Z \)."," (Wait, that seems off. Let me read the problem again.)

2. **Re-read the Problem:**
   - ""Amelia has three times as many LinkedIn friends as Zahra."" So, Amelia's friends are \( 3Z \).
   - ""Mei has ten times as many friends on LinkedIn as Zahra."" So, Mei's friends are \( 10Z \).
   - ""Amelia has 45 friends on LinkedIn."" So, \( 3Z = 45 \).

3. **Solve for \( Z \):**
   - From \( 3Z = 45 \), divide both sides by 3 to find \( Z \):
     \[
     Z = \frac{45}{3} = 15
     \]

4. **Find Mei's Friends:**
   - Mei has \( 10Z \) friends.
   - Substitute \( Z = 15 \):

We are given that Wei swims a mile in 26 minutes when the water is cold.

### Step 2: Time to swim 1 mile on a hot day
When the water is warm, Wei",deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,qwen/qwq-32b-preview,DeepInfra,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Wei takes to swim 6 miles on a cold day and on a hot day, and then find the difference between these two times.

### Step 1: Time to swim 1 mile on a cold day
We are given that Wei swims a mile in 30 minutes when the water is cold.

### Step 2: Time to swim 1 mile on a hot day
When the water is warm, Wei"," swims a mile in 5 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day.

First, calculate twice the time taken on a cold day:
\[
2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Then, add 5 minutes to this time:
\[
60 + 5 = 65 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, on a hot day, Wei takes 65 minutes to swim a mile.

### Step 3: Time to swim 6 miles on a cold day
Since it takes 30 minutes to swim one mile on a cold day, for 6 miles:
\[
6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Time to swim 6 miles on a hot day
Similarly, on a hot day, it takes 65 minutes per mile, so for 6 miles:
\[
6 \times 65 = 390 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Difference in time

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Cost of Laser Tag:**
   - Each person (Mia and her friends) plays one round of laser tag.
   - Cost per round of laser tag = ₺15",".
   - If Mia invites \( n \) friends, then the total number of people is \( n + 1 \) (including Mia).
   - Total cost for laser tag = \( 15 \times (n + 1) \).

2. **Cost of Pinball Tokens:**
   - Each person gets ₺5 in pinball tokens.
   - Total cost for pinball tokens = \( 5 \times (n + 1) \).

3. **Cost of Roller Coaster Rides:**
   - Each person rides the roller coaster seven times.
   - Cost per ride = ₺5.
   - Cost per person for roller coaster = \( 7 \times 5 = 35 \) ₺.
   - Total cost for roller coaster for all people = \( 35 \times (n + 1) \).

4. **Total Budget:**
   - The sum of all these costs should not exceed ₺300.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     15(n + 1) + 5(n + 1) + 35(n + 1) \leq 300
     \]

### Simplifying the Equation:

First, combine like terms:

\[
15(n + 1) + 5(n + 1) + 35(n + 1) = (15 + 5 + 35)(n + 1) = 55(n + 1)
\]

So, the inequality becomes:

\[
55(n + 1) \leq 300
\]

### Solving for \( n \):

1. Divide both sides by 55:

\[
n + 1 \leq \frac{300}{55} \approx 5.4545
\]

2. Since \( n + 1 \) must be an integer (as you can't have a fraction of a person), we take the floor value:

\[
n + 1 \leq 5

\[
2 \times 55 = 110 \text{ customers per day}
\]

### Step"," 2: Calculate Daily Total

To find the total number of customers processed by both in one day, we add their individual daily totals:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Infection:**
   - On day 0, there are 16 people infected.

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 16 infected people infects 2 others.
   - New infections on"," day 1: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
   - Total infected by the end of day 1: \( 16 + 32 = 48 \)

3. **Day 2:**
   - Now, there are 48 infected people.
   - Each of these 48 infected people infects 2 others.
   - New infections on day 2: \( 48 \times 2 = 96 \)
   - Total infected by the end of day 2: \( 48 + 96 = 144 \)

4. **Day 3:**
   - Now, there are 144 infected people.
   - Each of these 144 infected people infects 2 others.
   - New infections on day 3: \( 144 \times 2 = 288 \)
   - Total infected by the end of day 3: \( 144 + 288 = 432 \)

### Final Answer:

\[ \boxed{432} \]

### Explanation:

This problem involves exponential growth because the number of infected people increases by a factor each day. Specifically, each infected person infects 2 others daily, leading to a multiplication of infected individuals over time.

- **Initial Condition:** 16 infected people.
- **Daily Infection Rate:** Each infected person infects 2 others.

Thus, the total number of infected people after each day can be calculated by considering both the existing infected individuals and the new infections they cause.

- **Day 0:** 16 infected.
- **Day 1:** 16 (existing) + (16 × 2) new = 16 + 32 = 48 infected.
- **Day 2:** 48 (existing) + (48 × 2) new = 48 + 96 = 144 infected.
- **Day 3:** 144 (existing) + (144 × 2) new = 144 + 288 = 432 infected.

Therefore, after 3 days, the total number of infected people is 432.

### Alternative Approach:

An alternative way to approach this problem is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series where each day the number of new infections is multiplied by 2.

- **Day 0:** 16
- **Day 1:** 16 × 2 = 32 new infections
- **Day 2:** 32 × 2 = 64 new infections
- **Day 3:** 64 × 2 = 128 new infections

Total infected after 3 days would be the sum of all infections over the days:

\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

However, this approach seems to differ from the initial step-by-step calculation. Let's verify.

### Verification:

Upon reviewing, it appears there was a mistake in the alternative approach. The issue lies in how new infections are calculated and summed.

- **Day 0:** 16 infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 16 infects 2 others → 16 × 2 = 32 new infections → Total: 16 + 32 = 48
- **Day 2:** Each of the 48 infects 2 others → 48 × 2 = 96 new infections → Total: 48 + 96 = 144
- **Day 3:** Each of the 144 infects 2 others → 144 × 2 = 288 new infections → Total: 144 + 288 = 432

Thus, the initial step-by-step approach is correct, and the total number of infected people after 3 days is indeed 432.

The alternative approach incorrectly assumed that only new infections each day are multiplied by 2, without accounting for the cumulative total of infected individuals.

### Conclusion:

The correct total number of infected people after 3 days is 432.
