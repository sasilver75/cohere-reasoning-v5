1,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,3,deepseek/deepseek-chat,DeepSeek,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber required:**
   - The robe takes **2 bolts** of blue fiber.

2. **Determine the amount of white fiber required:**
   - The robe takes **half** the amount of blue fiber for white fiber.
   - Half of 2 bolts is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

3. **Calculate the total amount","To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber required:**
   - The robe takes **2 bolts** of blue fiber.
