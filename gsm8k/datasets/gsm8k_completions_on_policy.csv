0,Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,18,"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and uses for muffins.
3. Determine the number of eggs left to sell.
4. Multiply the number of eggs left by the price per egg.

Let's go through each step:

1. Total number of eggs laid per day",":
   - The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. Number of eggs Janet eats and uses for muffins:
   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - Janet uses 4 eggs for muffins.
   - Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

3. Number of eggs left to sell:
   - Total eggs laid: 16
   - Eggs used: 7
   - Eggs left to sell: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - Price per egg: $2
   - Number of eggs left to sell: 9
   - Daily earnings: 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is $18.",True
1,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,3,"To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber required:**
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **Determine the amount of white fiber required:**
   - The robe takes half the amount of blue fiber in white fiber.
   - Half of 2 bolts is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}",meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct,DeepInfra,command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,"To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required:
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. Determine the amount of white fiber required:
   - The robe takes half the amount of blue fiber in white fiber.
   - Half of 2 bolts is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{2}{1} = 2 \text{ bolts}","
     \]
   - Therefore, the robe takes 2 bolts of white fiber.

3. Calculate the total number of bolts:
   - Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
     \[
     2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (white)} = 4 \text{ bolts}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 4.",False
