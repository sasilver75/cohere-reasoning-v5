0,Rania saw a 210-foot whale with 7 72-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,20,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about Rania seeing a 210-foot whale that has 7 remoras attached to it. Each remora is 72 inches long. We need to find out what percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of all the remoras. Hmm, percentages. Alright, so first, I need to get all the measurements into the same unit, right? Because the whale's length is in feet and the remoras are in inches. So converting either all to feet or all to inches. Let me think which would be easier.

The whale is 210 feet. Each remora is 72 inches. There are 7 remoras. Let me convert the remoras' length to feet because the whale's length is already in feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, so 72 inches divided by 12 would be 6 feet. Wait, 72 divided by 12 is 6. So each remora is 6 feet long. Then 7 remoras would be 7 times 6, which is 42 feet. So combined, the remoras are 42 feet long. The whale is 210 feet. So the percentage would be (42 / 210) * 100. Let me compute that. 42 divided by 210. Let's see, 210 divided by 42 is 5, so 42 is 1/5 of 210. 1/5 is 0.2, so 0.2 times 100 is 20%. So the combined length of the remoras is 20% of the whale's body length.

Wait, let me double-check. 72 inches per remora. 72 inches is 6 feet. 7 remoras: 7*6=42. Whale is 210. 42/210 = 0.2, which is 20%. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe check in inches. The whale is 210 feet. Convert that to inches. 210 feet * 12 inches per foot = 2520 inches. Each remora is 72 inches. 7 remoras: 7*72=504 inches. Then 504 / 2520 = 0.2, same as 20%. So either way, same answer. So the percentage is 20%.
 
 To determine the percentage of the whale's body length represented by the combined length of the remoras, follow these steps:

1. **Convert Units**:  
   - Whale's length: \(210\) feet.  
   - Each remora: \(72\) inches. Convert to feet:  
     \[
     \frac{72\ \text{inches}}{12\ \text{inches/foot}} = 6\ \text{feet per remora}.
     \]

2. **Total Length of Remoras**:  
   \[
   7\ \text{remoras} \times 6\ \text{feet/remora} = 42\ \text{feet}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Percentage**:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{42\ \text{feet}}{210\ \text{feet}} \right) \times 100 = 20\%.
   \]

**Answer**: The combined length of the remoras is **20%** of the whale's body length.",True
1,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 50 minutes to cover every 77 miles of the city. If the city is 77 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?",50,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about a fog bank covering a city. The question is asking how long it will take for the fog to cover the entire city, which is 77 miles across from the oceanfront to the inland edge. The given information is that it takes 50 minutes to cover every 77 miles of the city. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

So, the fog bank rolls in from the ocean. The time it takes is 50 minutes to cover every 77 miles. The city is 77 miles across. So, maybe the fog is moving at a certain speed, and we need to calculate how long it takes to cover the entire 77-mile width of the city.

Wait, if the city is 77 miles across and the fog takes 50 minutes to cover that same distance, then isn't the answer just 50 minutes? Because the problem says it takes 50 minutes to cover 77 miles, and the city is 77 miles across. That seems straightforward. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

The problem states: ""It takes 50 minutes to cover every 77 miles of the city."" Wait, maybe that's a rate. Like, the fog covers 77 miles in 50 minutes. So the speed would be 77 miles per 50 minutes. But if the city is 77 miles across, then the time required would be 50 minutes. So maybe the answer is 50 minutes. But why is the problem phrased that way? Let me check if there's a trick here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""cover every 77 miles"" refers to the area, but the city is 77 miles in one dimension. But the problem says ""from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge,"" which sounds like a linear distance, not area. So the distance is 77 miles, and the fog covers that distance in 50 minutes. So the time is 50 minutes. That seems too simple. Maybe the wording is tricky. Let me parse the problem again.

Original problem: ""It takes 50 minutes to cover every 77 miles of the city."" Wait, maybe ""cover every 77 miles"" is a rate, like per 77 miles. But if the city is exactly 77 miles, then the time is 50 minutes. Alternatively, maybe the fog is expanding in such a way that for each 77 miles of area, it takes 50 minutes. But that doesn't make sense because area would be square miles. The problem mentions the city is 77 miles across, which is a linear measure. So perhaps the answer is indeed 50 minutes. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's wording.

Wait, another way: Maybe the fog is moving at a speed where it covers 77 miles in 50 minutes. So speed is distance over time. So speed = 77 miles / 50 minutes. Then, to cover 77 miles, time = distance / speed. Which would be 77 miles / (77/50 miles per minute) = 50 minutes. So yes, that checks out. So the answer is 50 minutes. But why does the problem mention ""cover every 77 miles of the city""? Maybe it's trying to say that the rate is 77 miles per 50 minutes. So the speed is 77/50 miles per minute, which is 1.54 miles per minute. Then, for 77 miles, time is 77 divided by (77/50) which is 50 minutes. So the answer is 50 minutes. Therefore, the time taken is 50 minutes.
 
 The fog bank covers 77 miles in 50 minutes, as stated in the problem. Since the city is 77 miles across from the oceanfront to the inland edge, the fog will take exactly 50 minutes to cover the entire distance. 

**Answer:** 50 minutes.",True
2,Luis is rolling a 4-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,25,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Luis is rolling a 4-sided die. The question is asking how much more likely it is for him to roll a number greater than 2 compared to rolling two odd numbers in a row. And they want the answer as a percentage. Hmm, right. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out the probability of each event separately. Let's start with the first event: rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll of a 4-sided die. A 4-sided die typically has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. So numbers greater than 2 are 3 and 4. That's two outcomes. Since there are four possible outcomes, the probability here would be 2 out of 4, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%. That part seems straightforward.

Now the second event is rolling two odd numbers in a row. This is two consecutive rolls, right? So each roll is independent. First, I need to find the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll, then square that (since it's two in a row) or multiply the probabilities. Let's check: on a 4-sided die, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. The odd numbers are 1 and 3. So again, two outcomes. So the probability of rolling an odd number in one roll is 2/4, which is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of two odds in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Wait, but the question is asking how much more likely the first event is compared to the second. So we need to compare the probability of rolling a number >2 (which is 1/2) to the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row (which is 1/4). The question is phrased as ""how much more likely is it... than..."", which I think translates to (P1 - P2)/P2 * 100% to get the percentage increase. Alternatively, maybe it's (P1 / P2 - 1) * 100%. Let me confirm that.

For example, if event A is 50% and event B is 25%, then A is twice as likely as B. So 50% is 100% more than 25% (since 25% * 2 = 50%). Wait, but how does that calculation work? Let's think. If you want to find how much more likely A is than B, you take the difference between the two probabilities and then divide by B's probability to get the percentage increase. So (A - B)/B * 100%. In this case, (0.5 - 0.25)/0.25 * 100% = (0.25/0.25)*100% = 100%. So that would mean it's 100% more likely. Alternatively, if you just take the ratio, 0.5 / 0.25 = 2, which is 200%, meaning A is 200% of B, so 100% more likely. Yeah, that makes sense.

So putting it all together: the first probability is 1/2, the second is 1/4. The difference is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. Then, to find how much more likely, we take (1/4) divided by (1/4) which is 1, so 100% more likely. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (P1 - P2)/P2 * 100. So (0.5 - 0.25)/0.25 = 0.25/0.25 = 1, so 100% more likely. So the answer is 100%.

But let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each probability again.

First event: numbers greater than 2 on a 4-sided die. Numbers are 1,2,3,4. So 3 and 4 are greater than 2. That's 2 out of 4, so 50% correct.

Second event: two odd numbers in a row. Each odd number is 1 and 3, so 2 out of 4, which is 50% per roll. So two in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, which is 25%. Correct.

Comparing 50% to 25%. The question is ""how much more likely is it that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?"" So the phrasing here is important. The way it's phrased, it's asking for the relative difference. So the formula is (P1 - P2)/P2 * 100%. So (0.5 - 0.25)/0.25 = 1, so 100%. So the answer is 100% more likely.

Alternatively, if someone thought it was (P1/P2)*100%, that would be 200%, but that's not the case. Because ""how much more likely"" implies the difference relative to the original. For example, if something is twice as likely, it's 100% more likely. So 200% of the original is a 100% increase. So yes, 100% is the correct answer here.

I think that's all. Let me just check if there's any other possible misunderstanding. For example, maybe the die is not standard? But the problem states it's a 4-sided die, and standard 4-sided dice (like those used in D&D) have numbers 1-4. So that's correct. Also, the two events: one is a single roll, the other is two consecutive rolls. So the probabilities are correctly calculated as independent events. So I think everything checks out. The answer should be 100%.
 
 To determine how much more likely it is for Luis to roll a number greater than 2 than to roll two odd numbers in a row, we calculate the probabilities of each event and compare them.

**1. Probability of rolling a number > 2:**
- A 4-sided die has outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Numbers greater than 2: 3 and 4 (2 favorable outcomes).
- Probability = \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \) or **50%**.

**2. Probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row:**
- Odd numbers on the die: 1 and 3 (2 favorable outcomes).
- Probability of one odd roll = \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).
- For two consecutive odd rolls (independent events): \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or **25%**.

**3. Comparing the probabilities:**
- **Difference**: \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \).
- **Relative likelihood**: \( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \times 100\% = 100\% \).

**Final Answer**: Luis is **100%** more likely to roll a number greater than 2 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.",False
3,"A group of 190 students has various hobbies. 19 like to paint, 7 like to play football, and the rest like to either bake or hike. How many like to bake if the number that like to hike is twice the number that prefer playing football?",150,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So there's a problem here about 190 students and their hobbies. The question is asking how many like to bake, given that the number who like hiking is twice the number that prefer playing football. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the information given. The total number of students is 190. Out of these, 19 like painting, 7 like playing football, and the rest like either baking or hiking. So the remaining students after subtracting those who paint and play football must be the ones who bake or hike.

Let me write that down. Total students = 190. Painters = 19, Football players =7. So the sum of painters and football players is 19 +7 =26. Therefore, the remaining students are 190 -26 =164. These 164 students are divided between baking and hiking.

Now, the problem states that the number of students who like hiking is twice the number that prefer playing football. Wait, the football players are 7, right? So twice that would be 2*7=14. So hikers are 14? Wait, but that seems low. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says ""the number that like to hike is twice the number that prefer playing football."" So hiking = 2 * football. Football is 7, so hiking is 14. Then the remaining students (164) are split into baking and hiking. If hiking is 14, then baking would be 164 -14 =150. But wait, that would mean 150 like to bake. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me go through it again. The total is 190. 19 paint, 7 play football. The rest bake or hike. Hiking is twice the number of football players. So hiking is 14. Then the rest (190 -19 -7 -14) would be the bakers. Wait, that's a different way to calculate. Let's see:

Total = Paint + Football + Hike + Bake.

We know Paint=19, Football=7, Hike=2*Football=14. So adding those three: 19+7+14=40. Then Bake = Total -40 =190-40=150. So yes, that's 150. So the answer should be 150.

But wait, let me confirm. The rest (after paint and football) are bake or hike. So 190 -19 -7 =164. Then among these 164, hikers are twice football (7), so 14. So 164 -14 =150. Yep, same result. So the answer is 150. That seems straightforward. I don't think I missed anything here. Let me just check once more.

Alternative approach: Let's denote variables. Let B be the number of bakers, H the number of hikers. We know that H = 2*Football =2*7=14. Then total students: Paint + Football + H + B =190. So 19 +7 +14 +B=190. 19+7=26, 26+14=40. So 40 +B=190. Therefore, B=150. Yep, same answer. So I think that's correct.
 
 To determine how many students like to bake, follow these steps:

1. **Total Students**: 190  
2. **Painters**: 19  
3. **Football Players**: 7  
4. **Hikers**: Twice the number of football players → \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \)  

**Calculate remaining students (bakers + hikers):**  
\( 190 - 19 - 7 = 164 \)  

**Subtract hikers to find bakers:**  
\( 164 - 14 = 150 \)  

**Final Answer**:  
\(\boxed{150}\)",True
4,"Zahra is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 60 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then 4 times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to 6 times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Zahra takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Zahra have to eat?",885,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many popcorn pieces Zahra has to eat. Hmm, the problem is broken down into different time intervals, each with different popping rates. I need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second segment and then sum them all up. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the initial 30 seconds: 60 kernels pop. That's straightforward. So first interval is 60.

Then, the next 30 seconds (so from 30 to 60 seconds total), it says 4 times that amount. Wait, ""that amount"" refers to the first 30 seconds, right? So 4 times 60. Let me check: 4 * 60 = 240. So second interval is 240.

Next, the following 30 seconds (60 to 90 seconds), the popping increases to 6 times the initial rate. The initial rate was 60 in 30 seconds. So 6 times that would be 6 * 60 = 360. So third interval is 360.

Then, the final 30 seconds (90 to 120 seconds), the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. The past 30 seconds here would be the third interval, which was 360. So half of that rate would be 360 / 2 = 180. Wait, but does ""rate"" mean per 30 seconds? Because the previous rate was 360 in 30 seconds. So half of that rate would be 180 per 30 seconds. So fourth interval is 180.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from residual heat. The final 30 seconds of cooking was 180. So a quarter of 180 is 180 / 4 = 45. So that's an additional 45 popped after removing from heat.

Now, sum all these up: 60 (first) + 240 (second) + 360 (third) + 180 (fourth) + 45 (residual). Let's add them step by step.

60 + 240 = 300.

300 + 360 = 660.

660 + 180 = 840.

840 + 45 = 885.

So total popcorn pieces would be 885. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First interval: 60. Correct.

Second: 4 times first, 4*60=240. Correct.

Third: 6 times initial rate. Initial rate was 60, so 6*60=360. Correct.

Fourth: half the rate of the past 30 seconds (third interval's rate). Third was 360, so half is 180. Correct.

Residual: 1/4 of final 30 seconds (180) is 45. Correct.

Adding all: 60+240=300; +360=660; +180=840; +45=885. Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be 885.
 
 Zahra's popcorn popping occurs in five stages, each calculated as follows:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 60 kernels pop.  
2. **Next 30 seconds (30–60 seconds):** 4 times the initial amount:  
   \(4 \times 60 = 240\).  
3. **Next 30 seconds (60–90 seconds):** 6 times the initial rate:  
   \(6 \times 60 = 360\).  
4. **Final 30 seconds (90–120 seconds):** Half the previous rate (360):  
   \(360 \div 2 = 180\).  
5. **After removing from heat:** Residual popping equals a quarter of the final 30 seconds:  
   \(180 \div 4 = 45\).  

**Total popcorn:**  
\(60 + 240 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 885\).

5,"Sofia makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 97:37. If she used a total of 1474 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",1067,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Sofia makes coffee with sugar and water in the ratio 97:37. The total amount used is 1474 teaspoons. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. But the total is given as 1474 teaspoons. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. Because cups of water are a different unit, but maybe the problem is combining them as parts? Like, the ratio is parts of sugar to parts of water, and each part is equal in some measure. But the total parts would be 97 + 37. Let me check that again.

The ratio is 97 teaspoons of sugar to 37 cups of water. So, for every 97 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 37 cups of water. But the total combined is 1474. Wait, but how can you add teaspoons and cups? Unless the problem is considering them as parts of the total mixture, but that doesn't make sense because they are different units. Oh, maybe the problem is simplifying it by treating them as unitless parts. So, the ratio 97:37 is parts of sugar to parts of water, regardless of the actual units. Then the total parts would be 97 + 37 = 134 parts. And the total mixture is 1474 parts. So each part would be 1474 divided by 134. Then multiply by 97 to get the sugar.

Wait, but the problem says ""calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used."" So maybe the answer is just the number of teaspoons, which is 97 parts. Let me proceed step by step.

First, the ratio of sugar to water is 97:37. So total parts = 97 + 37 = 134 parts. The total mixture is 1474 teaspoons and cups combined. Wait, but the problem states ""a total of 1474 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water"". So the total is 1474 units, which are a combination of teaspoons (sugar) and cups (water). But how can you add teaspoons and cups? Unless the problem is using ""teaspoons"" as a unit for both, which might be a mistake. Wait, maybe the problem is written in a way that the ratio is 97 parts sugar to 37 parts water, each part being a teaspoon. But that doesn't make sense for water. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ratio as teaspoons of sugar per cup of water. But then the total would be in different units. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to treat both as parts, regardless of their actual units. So, even though sugar is measured in teaspoons and water in cups, the ratio is 97:37, and the total number of parts is 97 + 37 = 134. Then, the total ""parts"" are 1474, so each part is 1474 / 134. Then, sugar is 97 parts. Let me try that.

So, total parts = 97 + 37 = 134. Each part is equal to 1474 / 134. Let me compute that. 134 times 11 is 1474, because 134*10=1340, plus 134 is 1474. So 1474 divided by 134 is 11. So each part is 11. Therefore, sugar is 97 parts, so 97 * 11 = 1067. So the answer would be 1067 teaspoons of sugar.

Wait, but let me verify. If each part is 11, then sugar is 97*11=1067, water is 37*11=407. Then total is 1067 + 407 = 1474. Yes, that adds up. So that makes sense. So even though the units are different (teaspoons and cups), the problem is treating them as parts in the ratio. So the answer is 1067.
 
 Sofia uses sugar and water in the ratio 97:37. This means for every 97 parts of sugar, there are 37 parts of water. 

**Total parts:**  
97 (sugar) + 37 (water) = 134 parts.

**Value of one part:**  
Total mixture = 1474 teaspoons and cups.  
Each part = \( \frac{1474}{134} = 11 \).

**Sugar used:**  
\( 97 \times 11 = 1067 \) teaspoons.

6,Pavel has 30 square yards of orange field. There are 94 oranges per square yard. Pavel can harvest his oranges every 12 months. How many oranges can Pavel harvest within a year?,2820,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Pavel has this orange field, right? The problem says he has 30 square yards of land. Each square yard has 94 oranges. And he can harvest them every 12 months. The question is asking how many oranges he can harvest within a year. Hmm.

Wait, so first, I need to figure out the total number of oranges he has in his field. Since he has 30 square yards and each one produces 94 oranges, I should multiply those two numbers together. Let me check that. 30 times 94. Let me calculate that. 30 times 90 is 2700, and 30 times 4 is 120, so adding those together gives 2820. So total oranges would be 2820.

But wait, the problem mentions that he can harvest every 12 months. So does that mean he harvests once a year? Because 12 months is a year. So if he harvests once a year, then the total number of oranges he can harvest in a year would be the entire 2820. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me read the problem again.

""Pavel can harvest his oranges every 12 months. How many oranges can Pavel harvest within a year?"" Oh, right. So if he harvests every 12 months, that's once per year. So within one year, he would harvest once. Therefore, the total is indeed 30 times 94, which is 2820. So the answer should be 2820 oranges.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Like, maybe the question is trying to see if I consider multiple harvests in a year. But the problem says he can harvest every 12 months. So that's once a year. So no, there's no multiple harvests. So the calculation is straightforward. Multiply the area by the yield per area. 30 * 94 = 2820. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the answer.
 
 Pavel's orange field is 30 square yards in size, and each square yard yields 94 oranges. To find the total number of oranges he can harvest in a year:

1. **Calculate total oranges per harvest**:  
   \( 30 \, \text{square yards} \times 94 \, \text{oranges/square yard} = 2,\!820 \, \text{oranges} \).

2. **Harvest frequency**: The problem states Pavel harvests every 12 months, meaning once per year.  

**Final Answer**: Pavel can harvest **2,820 oranges** within a year.",True

If his farm truck can carry 180 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",9,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The farmer needs to transport all the feed he bought, but his truck can only carry 180 kg per trip. I need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed first, then sum them all up to find the total weight. After that, divide by the truck's capacity to see how many trips he needs. But wait, since you can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll have to round up if there's any remainder.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's handle each type of feed:

Oats: He buys five 3-kg boxes. So 5 multiplied by 3 kg. That's 5 * 3 = 15 kg.

Cucumbers: Thirteen 6-kg bags. So 13 * 6. Let me calculate that. 10*6 is 60, 3*6 is 18, so 60+18=78 kg.

Apples: Thirty-one 42-kg packs. Hmm, 31 * 42. Let me compute that. 30*42 is 1260, and 1*42 is 42, so total is 1260 +42= 1302 kg.

Wheats: Fifteen 15-kg sacks. 15 *15. That's 225 kg.

Now, adding all these together. Let's sum each category:

Oats: 15 kg

Cucumbers: 78 kg

Apples: 1302 kg

Wheats: 225 kg

Total weight = 15 +78 +1302 +225.

Let me add them step by step. 15 +78 is 93. Then 93 +1302 is 1395. Then 1395 +225 is 1620 kg total.

So the total weight is 1620 kg. The truck can carry 180 kg per trip. So the number of trips needed is 1620 divided by 180.

Let me compute that. 1620 ÷ 180. Hmm, 180 times 9 is 1620 (because 180*10=1800, minus 180 is 1620). So 9 trips exactly. Wait, that's a whole number, so no remainder. So he needs 9 trips.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Oats: 5*3=15. Correct.

Cucumbers: 13*6=78. Correct.

Apples: 31*42. Let me check again. 30*42=1260, 1*42=42. 1260+42=1302. Correct.

Wheats:15*15=225. Correct.

Total: 15+78=93. 93+1302=1395. 1395+225=1620. Yes.

1620 divided by 180. Let's see, 180*9=1620. So 9 trips. So the answer is 9 trips. That seems straightforward. I don't think I missed anything here. All the steps add up correctly. So the farmer needs to make 9 trips.
 
 The farmer needs to calculate the total weight of each feed type and determine the number of trips required to transport all feed with a truck capacity of 180 kg per trip.

**Calculations:**
- **Oats:** \(5 \text{ boxes} \times 3 \text{ kg/box} = 15 \text{ kg}\)
- **Cucumbers:** \(13 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ kg/bag} = 78 \text{ kg}\)
- **Apples:** \(31 \text{ packs} \times 42 \text{ kg/pack} = 1,302 \text{ kg}\)
- **Wheats:** \(15 \text{ sacks} \times 15 \text{ kg/sack} = 225 \text{ kg}\)

**Total Weight:**  
\(15 \text{ kg} + 78 \text{ kg} + 1,302 \text{ kg} + 225 \text{ kg} = 1,620 \text{ kg}\)

8,"A juggler can juggle 640 balls. An eighth of the balls are tennis balls, and 1/10 of the tennis balls are white. How many white tennis balls are there?",8,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about a juggler who can juggle 640 balls. Then it says an eighth of the balls are tennis balls. And of those tennis balls, 1/10 are white. The question is asking how many white tennis balls there are.

Hmm, so first, I need to find out how many tennis balls there are in total. Since the juggler has 640 balls, and an eighth of them are tennis balls. So to find the number of tennis balls, I should calculate 640 divided by 8. Let me do that. 640 divided by 8. Let's see, 8 times 80 is 640, right? So 640 divided by 8 is 80. So there are 80 tennis balls.

Now, out of these 80 tennis balls, 1/10 are white. So I need to find 1/10 of 80. That would be 80 divided by 10. 80 divided by 10 is 8. So there are 8 white tennis balls.

Wait, let me double-check. If I take 1/8 of 640, that's 80. Then 1/10 of 80 is 8. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be 8.
 
 To determine the number of white tennis balls, follow these steps:

1. **Total Tennis Balls**:  
   An eighth of the 640 balls are tennis balls.  
   \( \frac{1}{8} \times 640 = 80 \) tennis balls.

2. **White Tennis Balls**:  
   A tenth of the tennis balls are white.

How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",59,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about Mei and her brother's toys. We need to find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube she bought. Let me break down the information given.

First, there are different types of toys mentioned. The bag of building blocks has 71 blocks. Then there's a bin of stuffed animals with 45. The tower of stacking rings has 29 rings. Then Mei bought a tube of bouncy balls, and after that, the total number of toys became 204. So the question is, how many bouncy balls are in the tube?

Hmm, so the total after adding the bouncy balls is 204. That means if we add up all the existing toys and the bouncy balls, the sum should be 204. So the existing toys are blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. Let me add those up first.

Blocks: 71
Stuffed animals: 45
Stacking rings: 29

Adding those together. Let's do 71 + 45 first. 70 + 40 is 110, and 1 +5 is 6, so 116. Then add 29 to 116. 116 + 20 is 136, then plus 9 is 145. So the total of the existing toys is 145.

Now, the total after adding the bouncy balls is 204. So the number of bouncy balls must be 204 minus the existing toys. So 204 - 145. Let me calculate that. 204 minus 100 is 104, then minus 45 more. 104 - 40 is 64, minus 5 is 59. So the tube has 59 bouncy balls.

Wait, let me check that again. 71 +45 is 116, right? 71 +40 is 111, plus 5 is 116. Then 116 +29. 116 +20 is 136, plus 9 is 145. Yes. Then 204 -145. 200 -145 is 55, plus 4 is 59. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be 59.
 
 To determine how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we first calculate the total number of existing toys Mei had before purchasing the tube:

- **Building blocks**: 71  
- **Stuffed animals**: 45  
- **Stacking rings**: 29  

**Sum of existing toys**:  
71 + 45 = 116  
116 + 29 = 145  

After adding the bouncy balls, the total number of toys becomes **204**. The number of bouncy balls is the difference between the new total and the existing toys:  

204 − 145 = **59**  

**Answer**: The tube contained **59 bouncy balls**.",True
10,"To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay $0.9 for each minute of your call. After 20 minutes, that price drops to $0.5 per minute. How much would a 86-minute call cost?",51,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the cost of an 86-minute call using the hotel room phone. The problem says that the first 20 minutes cost $0.9 per minute, and after that, it drops to $0.5 per minute. Hmm, so the total cost would be the sum of the cost for the first 20 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes beyond 20.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The first 20 minutes are charged at $0.9 each, and any time beyond those initial 20 minutes is charged at the lower rate of $0.5 per minute. So for an 86-minute call, the first 20 minutes are at the higher rate, and the remaining 66 minutes (since 86 minus 20 is 66) are at the lower rate. 

Let me break it down step by step. First, calculate the cost for the first 20 minutes. That would be 20 minutes multiplied by $0.9 per minute. Let me do that math: 20 * 0.9. 20 times 0.9 is 18. So the first part is $18.00.

Then, the remaining minutes after the first 20. The total call is 86 minutes, so subtracting the initial 20 gives 86 - 20 = 66 minutes. These 66 minutes are charged at $0.5 per minute. So that's 66 * 0.5. Let me calculate that. 60 * 0.5 is 30, and 6 * 0.5 is 3, so 30 + 3 = 33. So the second part is $33.00.

Now, adding both parts together: $18.00 + $33.00 equals $51.00. So the total cost for the 86-minute call should be $51.00. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

First part: 20 minutes * $0.9/min. 20 * 0.9 is indeed 18. Correct. 

Second part: 86 - 20 = 66 minutes. 66 * 0.5. Let me compute that again. 66 divided by 2 is 33. Yes, that's right. So 66 * 0.5 is 33. 

Adding 18 and 33 gives 51. So the total cost is $51.00. 

I think that's all. The key here is splitting the call duration into the two pricing tiers and calculating each part separately before summing them up. There's no mention of any connection fees or other charges, so I assume it's just the per-minute rates applied as described. 

Another way to check: Maybe calculate the entire 86 minutes at the lower rate and then adjust for the first 20 minutes. Wait, no, because the first 20 are at the higher rate. Alternatively, if all minutes were at $0.9, that would be 86*0.9=77.4. Then subtract the difference for the minutes beyond 20. The difference per minute is 0.9 - 0.5 = 0.4. So for 66 minutes, the savings would be 66*0.4 = 26.4. So 77.4 - 26.4 = 51.0. Yep, same result. So that confirms it. 

Therefore, the answer should be $51.
 
 To calculate the cost of an 86-minute call with the given pricing structure:

1. **First 20 minutes**:  
   Cost = 20 minutes × $0.9/minute = **$18.00**.

2. **Remaining minutes**:  
   Total call duration = 86 minutes  
   Minutes after the first 20 = 86 - 20 = **66 minutes**  
   Cost = 66 minutes × $0.5/minute = **$33.00**.

3. **Total Cost**:  
   $18.00 (first 20 minutes) + $33.00 (remaining 66 minutes) = **$51.00**.

**Answer:** $51.00",True

If he makes 8 giant cubes, 15 small cubes, and 13 medium cubes, how many grams of water does he have left?",86,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Pavel wants to make different ice cubes using 328 grams of water. The problem is asking how much water he has left after making 8 giant cubes, 15 small cubes, and 13 medium cubes. Hmm, right. So I need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 328 grams.

First, let's break down each type of cube. The giant cubes use 12 grams each. He makes 8 of those. So for the giant cubes, the total water used would be 12 grams multiplied by 8. Let me compute that: 12 * 8 = 96 grams. Got that part.

Next, the medium cubes use 11 grams each. He makes 13 medium cubes. So that's 11 grams times 13. Let me calculate that. 11 * 13... Hmm, 10*13 is 130, plus 1*13 is 13, so 130+13=143 grams. So medium cubes take 143 grams total.

Then there's the small cubes. Each small cube uses 1/5 of a gram. He makes 15 of them. So that's 15 times 1/5 gram. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 15*(1/5) = 3 grams. So the small cubes use 3 grams in total.

Now, adding up all the water used: giant (96) + medium (143) + small (3). Let's add them step by step. 96 + 143 is... 96 + 100 is 196, then plus 43 more is 239. Then add the 3 grams from small cubes: 239 + 3 = 242 grams used in total.

He started with 328 grams. So the remaining water is 328 - 242. Let's subtract that. 328 minus 200 is 128, then minus 42 more (since 242 is 200+42). 128 - 42 = 86. So 86 grams left. Wait, let me check that again to be sure.

Wait, 328 - 242. Let's do it another way. 242 + 86 = 328? Let's see: 242 + 80 = 322, then +6 = 328. Yes, that's correct. So the remaining water is 86 grams. 

I think that's all. Let me just verify each step again. Giant cubes: 8*12=96. Medium:13*11=143. Small:15*(1/5)=3. Total used: 96+143=239, +3=242. 328-242=86. Yep, looks right. So the answer should be 86 grams left.
 
 After calculating the total water used for each type of ice cube and subtracting from the initial amount:

**Giant Cubes:**  
8 cubes × 12 grams/cube = 96 grams  
**Medium Cubes:**  
13 cubes × 11 grams/cube = 143 grams  
**Small Cubes:**  
15 cubes × (1/5 gram/cube) = 3 grams  

**Total Water Used:**  
96 + 143 + 3 = 242 grams

12,"Ravi places crackers on some trays. Each tray can hold 28 crackers. If he has 252 crackers and 7 trays, how many crackers won't he be able to place on the tray?",56,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Ravi has 252 crackers and 7 trays. Each tray can hold 28 crackers. The question is asking how many crackers he won't be able to place on the trays. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many crackers he can fit into the trays first, and then subtract that from the total to find the leftover ones.

First, maybe I should calculate the total number of crackers the trays can hold. Since each tray holds 28 and there are 7 trays, multiply 28 by 7. Let me do that. 28 times 7... 28 times 7 is 196. Wait, let me check again. 20 times 7 is 140, and 8 times 7 is 56. Adding those together gives 140 + 56 = 196. Yeah, that's right. So all the trays together can hold 196 crackers.

But Ravi has 252 crackers. So the number he can't place would be the total he has minus the total the trays can hold. So 252 minus 196. Let me compute that. 252 - 196. Hmm, 252 minus 200 would be 52, but since it's 196, which is 4 less than 200, so adding back 4 gives 52 + 4 = 56. Wait, no. Wait, if I subtract 196 from 252, maybe another way. Let's do it step by step. 252 - 196. 

Alternatively, think of 196 as 200 - 4. So 252 - (200 - 4) = 252 - 200 + 4 = 52 + 4 = 56. Yeah, that works. So 252 - 196 equals 56. So Ravi won't be able to place 56 crackers on the trays. 

Wait, let me verify once more. 7 trays times 28 each is 196. 252 minus 196 is indeed 56. So the answer should be 56. I think that's correct. No steps seem missed here. He can't place 56 crackers because the trays are full.
 
 Ravi has 252 crackers and 7 trays, each holding 28 crackers. To find how many crackers won't fit:

1. **Calculate total capacity of trays**:  
   \( 7 \text{ trays} \times 28 \text{ crackers/tray} = 196 \text{ crackers} \).

She already has 7 potted plants on each of the 52 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Camila remain with?",81,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many potted plants Camila will have left after giving some away. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. 

First, Camila received 29 new potted plants two days ago. So that's straightforward—she has an additional 29 plants. Then, she already has 7 potted plants on each of the 52 window ledges. Oh right, so each ledge has 7 plants. So to find the total number of existing plants before the new ones, I need to multiply 52 by 7. Let me do that calculation. 52 times 7... 50 times 7 is 350, and 2 times 7 is 14, so 350 plus 14 is 364. So she had 364 plants already on the ledges.

Then she adds the 29 new ones. Wait, does she add those to the existing ones on the ledges, or are they separate? The problem says she received 29 new potted plants, and she already has 7 on each ledge. Then she's giving away 6 from each ledge. So maybe the 29 new ones are in addition to the existing ones. But the problem doesn't specify where she puts the new plants. Hmm. Wait, the problem says she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge. So perhaps the 29 new plants are added to the existing ones on the ledges, or maybe they are separate. This is a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again.

""Camila is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 29 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 7 potted plants on each of the 52 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Camila remain with?""

So the 29 new plants are separate from the existing ones. But where are they placed? The problem doesn't say she added them to the window ledges. So maybe the existing plants are 7 per ledge (total 52*7=364), and the new 29 are separate. Then, when she gives away 6 from each ledge, that affects the existing plants. But the problem says she's giving away 6 from each ledge, so each ledge currently has 7, and she gives away 6, leaving 1 per ledge. Then the total remaining on the ledges would be 52*1=52. Plus the 29 new ones? Wait, but maybe the 29 new ones are also on the ledges. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says she received 29 new potted plants two days ago. Then she already has 7 on each of 52 ledges. So the 29 new plants are in addition to the existing ones. But where are they placed? If each ledge already has 7, maybe she added the 29 to the existing ledges. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the 29 are not on the ledges yet. But the problem says she is giving away 6 from each ledge. So perhaps the 29 are not on the ledges, so they aren't part of the plants being given away. Wait, but that might not make sense. Let me try to model this.

Original plants: 52 ledges * 7 plants each = 364.

New plants: 29.

Total plants before giving away: 364 + 29 = 393.

But then she gives away 6 plants from each ledge. So each ledge originally had 7, she gives away 6, so each ledge now has 1 plant left. So total plants remaining on ledges: 52 * 1 = 52.

But what about the 29 new plants? Are they on the ledges? If she added the 29 to the existing ledges, then each ledge would have more than 7. But the problem doesn't say that. It says she received 29 new plants, but the existing ones are 7 per ledge. So perhaps the 29 are not on the ledges yet. Then when she gives away 6 from each ledge, those are taken from the original 7 per ledge. So the 29 new plants would remain untouched. Therefore, the total remaining would be 52*1 (from the ledges) plus 29 new ones. So 52 +29=81.

Alternatively, maybe the 29 new plants are distributed onto the ledges. For example, adding them to the existing 7. But the problem doesn't state that. The problem says she received 29 new plants, but the existing count is 7 per ledge. So perhaps the 29 are separate. Let's check the problem again.

The problem says: ""she received 29 new potted plants... She already has 7 potted plants on each of the 52 window ledges... she will give 6 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.""

So the key here is that the 29 new plants are not mentioned as being on the ledges. So when she gives away plants, it's from the ledges. Therefore, the 29 new plants are separate and not part of the ledges. Therefore, after giving away 6 from each ledge, the ledges will have 1 each (7-6=1), so 52*1=52 plants remaining on ledges. Then the 29 new plants are still there, so total is 52 +29=81.

But wait, maybe the 29 new plants are placed on the ledges. For example, if she adds them to the existing ledges, then each ledge would have 7 + (29/52), but that's not possible because you can't have a fraction of a plant. Alternatively, maybe she adds the 29 to some ledges. But the problem doesn't specify that. The problem states that she already has 7 on each ledge. The 29 new plants are received, but their placement isn't specified. Therefore, it's safer to assume that the 29 are not on the ledges and thus are not part of the plants being given away. Therefore, they remain as part of her total.

Alternatively, perhaps the 29 are added to the existing plants. For example, maybe she adds them to the ledges, making each ledge have 7 + (29/52), but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe she adds them to the existing count. Wait, but 29 can't be evenly distributed across 52 ledges. So perhaps the 29 are kept separate. The problem is a bit ambiguous here, but in math problems, usually, such details are specified. Since it's not specified that the new plants are added to the ledges, we can assume they are kept elsewhere. Therefore, when she gives away plants from the ledges, the 29 are not affected.

So the calculation would be:

Original plants on ledges: 52 *7 = 364.

After giving away 6 per ledge: each ledge has 7-6=1, so 52*1=52 plants left on ledges.

Plus the 29 new plants not on the ledges: 52 +29=81.

Therefore, the answer is 81.

Wait, but let me check again. If the 29 new plants are on the ledges, then each ledge would have 7 + (29/52), but that's not possible. So perhaps the 29 are additional plants not on the ledges. So they remain. Therefore, total is 52 +29=81.

Alternatively, maybe the 29 are added to the ledges. For example, she adds them to the existing 7, making each ledge have 7 + x, but since 29 can't be divided evenly by 52, that's not possible. So the problem must assume that the 29 are separate. Therefore, the answer is 81.
 
 Camila starts with two groups of plants: existing ones on window ledges and 29 new plants. 

1. **Existing plants on ledges**:  
   Each of the 52 ledges has 7 plants.  
   Total = \(52 \times 7 = 364\) plants.

2. **Giving away plants**:  
   She donates 6 plants from each ledge.  
   Plants remaining per ledge = \(7 - 6 = 1\).  
   Total remaining on ledges = \(52 \times 1 = 52\) plants.

14,Keisha and Andre have 109 minutes to walk to the gym together. It takes them 27 minutes to get to the corner where the cinema is. It takes them another 31 minutes to get to the bank. How much longer do they have to get to gym without being late?,51,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Keisha and Andre have a total of 109 minutes to walk to the gym without being late. They first go to the corner where the cinema is, which takes 27 minutes. Then they go to the bank, which takes another 31 minutes. The question is asking how much longer they have to get to the gym without being late. Hmm, right.

So I need to figure out how much time they've already used and subtract that from the total time allowed. That should give the remaining time they have left to reach the gym. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the time to the cinema: 27 minutes. Then from the cinema to the bank: 31 minutes. So the total time spent so far is 27 plus 31. Let me add those. 27 + 31. Let's see, 20 + 30 is 50, and 7 + 1 is 8. So 50 + 8 = 58 minutes. So they've used 58 minutes already.

The total time they have is 109 minutes. So subtracting the time used from the total time gives the remaining time. So 109 minus 58. Let's calculate that. 109 - 50 is 59, then subtract 8 more: 59 - 8 = 51. So they have 51 minutes left. Therefore, they have 51 more minutes to get to the gym without being late.

Wait, but let me double-check the addition and subtraction to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 27 + 31: 20+30=50, 7+1=8, total 58. Yes. Then 109 - 58: 100-50=50, 9-8=1, so 50+1=51. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be 51 minutes.
 
 Keisha and Andre have a total of 109 minutes to reach the gym. They spend 27 minutes walking to the cinema and another 31 minutes to the bank. 

**Total time used so far:**  
27 minutes (to cinema) + 31 minutes (to bank) = **58 minutes**

**Remaining time to reach the gym:**  
109 total minutes - 58 minutes used = **51 minutes**

**Answer:** They have 51 more minutes to get to the gym without being late.",True
15,"Jasmine's dog has 1000 puppies, 270 of which have spots. Priya's dog has 640 puppies, 140 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?",25,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the percentage of all the puppies that have spots. So, there are two people here: Jasmine and Priya, each with their own dogs that have puppies. I need to find out the total number of puppies and then how many of those have spots. Then, I can calculate the percentage.

First, let's break down the numbers. Jasmine's dog has 1000 puppies, and out of those, 270 have spots. Priya's dog has 640 puppies, with 140 spotted. So, the first step is to add up all the puppies from both to get the total. Then, add up the spotted ones.

Total puppies = Jasmine's puppies + Priya's puppies. That would be 1000 + 640. Let me do that math. 1000 plus 600 is 1600, and then plus 40 more makes 1640. So total puppies are 1640.

Now, total spotted puppies. Jasmine has 270, Priya has 140. Adding those together: 270 + 140. Let's see, 200 + 100 is 300, 70 + 40 is 110. So 300 + 110 is 410. So total spotted puppies are 410.

Now, to find the percentage, the formula is (spotted / total) * 100. So that's (410 / 1640) * 100. Let me compute that. 

First, divide 410 by 1640. Hmm, maybe simplify the fraction. Both numbers can be divided by 10 first, so 41/164. Let's see if 41 and 164 have a common factor. 41 is a prime number, right? So check if 41 divides into 164. 41 times 4 is 164. Oh, right! So 41/164 is the same as 1/4. Because 41 divided by 41 is 1, and 164 divided by 41 is 4. So 1/4. Then 1 divided by 4 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is 25%.

Wait, let me double-check that. 41 times 4 is 164, yes. So 410 divided by 1640 is 0.25. So 25%. That makes sense. Let me verify with another approach. Let's compute 410 divided by 1640. If I divide numerator and denominator by 10, it's 41/164. Then, 164 divided by 41 is 4. So 41 divided by 164 is 1/4. Yep, that's 0.25. So 25% is correct.

So the percentage of all puppies that have spots is 25%.
 
 To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Puppies:**
   - Jasmine's puppies: 1000
   - Priya's puppies: 640
   - **Total = 1000 + 640 = 1640**

2. **Calculate Spotted Puppies:**
   - Jasmine's spotted: 270
   - Priya's spotted: 140
   - **Total Spotted = 270 + 140 = 410**

3. **Compute Percentage:**
   - Formula: \(\frac{\text{Spotted}}{\text{Total}} \times 100\)
   - \(\frac{410}{1640} = 0.25\)
   - **Percentage = \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\%\)**

**Answer:** 25% of all the puppies have spots.",True
16,"Kai is selling brownie and orange pie for a fundraiser. On Tuesday, he sold 21 boxes of brownie and 18 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Wednesday. On Wednesday, he sold 13 more boxes of brownies than on Tuesday and 27 boxes of orange pie. If the brownie cost ¥8 and the orange pie cost ¥28, how much did Kai earn for two days?",1448,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Kai is selling brownies and orange pies over two days, Tuesday and Wednesday. We need to find out how much he earned in total for both days. The problem gives us some information about the number of boxes sold each day and the prices. Let me break it down.

First, let's parse the information given. On Tuesday, he sold 21 boxes of brownies. Then, for the orange pies on Tuesday, it says he sold 18 fewer boxes than on Wednesday. Wait, so the number of orange pies sold on Tuesday is Wednesday's orange pies minus 18? But then, on Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of orange pies. Oh, right! Because the problem states that on Wednesday, he sold 27 boxes of orange pie. So, Tuesday's orange pies would be 27 minus 18. Let me check that again.

Wait, the problem says: ""On Tuesday, he sold 21 boxes of brownie and 18 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Wednesday."" So, Tuesday's orange pies = Wednesday's orange pies - 18. Since Wednesday's orange pies are 27, then Tuesday's would be 27 - 18 = 9. That seems right.

Then, for the brownies on Wednesday: ""On Wednesday, he sold 13 more boxes of brownies than on Tuesday."" So, Tuesday's brownies are 21, so Wednesday's would be 21 + 13 = 34.

So let's summarize:

Tuesday:
- Brownies: 21 boxes
- Orange pies: 27 (Wednesday's) - 18 = 9 boxes

Wednesday:
- Brownies: 21 + 13 = 34 boxes
- Orange pies: 27 boxes

Now, each brownie box costs ¥8 and each orange pie box is ¥28. So we need to calculate the earnings for each day and then sum them up.

Let's compute Tuesday's earnings first.

Tuesday's earnings from brownies: 21 * ¥8 = ?
21 * 8. Let's calculate that. 20*8=160, 1*8=8, so 160+8=168. So ¥168.

Tuesday's earnings from orange pies: 9 * ¥28. Hmm. Let's see. 10*28=280, so 9*28 is 280 - 28 = 252. So ¥252.

Total for Tuesday: 168 + 252 = 420. So ¥420.

Now Wednesday's earnings.

Wednesday's brownies: 34 boxes * ¥8. Let's compute 34*8. 30*8=240, 4*8=32. 240+32=272. So ¥272.

Wednesday's orange pies: 27 boxes * ¥28. Let's calculate that. 27*28. Hmm. Let's break it down. 20*28=560, 7*28=196. So 560+196=756. So ¥756.

Total for Wednesday: 272 + 756 = 1028. Wait, 272 + 756. Let me check that again. 200 + 700 = 900, 72 + 56 = 128. So 900 + 128 = 1028. Yes. So ¥1028.

Now, add both days' totals: 420 (Tuesday) + 1028 (Wednesday) = 1448. So the total earnings would be ¥1448.

Wait, let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Tuesday's orange pies: 27 (Wednesday's) minus 18 is indeed 9. Correct.

Wednesday's brownies: 21 (Tuesday's) plus 13 is 34. Correct.

Calculations for each day:

Tuesday:

21 brownies * 8 = 168. Correct.

9 orange pies *28 = 252. 9*28: 10*28=280, minus 28 is 252. Correct. 168+252=420. Correct.

Wednesday:

34*8: 30*8=240, 4*8=32, total 272. Correct.

27*28: 20*28=560, 7*28=196, total 756. Correct. 272+756=1028. Correct.

Total: 420 + 1028 = 1448. Yes. So the answer should be ¥1,448.
 
 Kai's earnings over the two days can be calculated as follows:

**Tuesday:**
- **Brownies:** 21 boxes × ¥8 = ¥168  
- **Orange Pies:** (Wednesday's orange pies - 18) = 27 - 18 = 9 boxes × ¥28 = ¥252  
- **Total for Tuesday:** ¥168 + ¥252 = **¥420**

**Wednesday:**
- **Brownies:** (Tuesday's brownies + 13) = 21 + 13 = 34 boxes × ¥8 = ¥272  
- **Orange Pies:** 27 boxes × ¥28 = ¥756  
- **Total for Wednesday:** ¥272 + ¥756 = **¥1,028**

**Combined Earnings:**  
¥420 (Tuesday) + ¥1,028 (Wednesday) = **¥1,448**

**Answer:** Kai earned a total of **¥1,448** over the two days.",True
17,"Mia walks 24 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 12 kilometers of walking on the beach and 12 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Mia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk, in minutes?",90,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how long it takes Mia to complete her entire 24-kilometer walk. Hmm, the problem says she walks 12 km on the beach and 12 km on the sidewalk each day. Her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. Also, she spends 60 minutes on the beach part. I need to find the total time for the whole walk.

First, maybe I should start by finding her speed on the beach. Since she walks 12 km on the beach and that takes 60 minutes, which is 1 hour, right? Wait, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So if she walks 12 km in 1 hour, her speed on the beach would be 12 km/h. Let me check that. Speed is distance divided by time. So 12 km divided by 1 hour is 12 km/h. Yeah, that makes sense.

Then, her speed on the sidewalk is twice that. So 12 km/h times 2 is 24 km/h. Okay, so she walks the sidewalk part at 24 km/h. Now, the sidewalk is also 12 km long. So how long does that take? Time is distance divided by speed. So 12 km divided by 24 km/h. Let's calculate that. 12 divided by 24 is 0.5 hours. Oh, right, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. So the sidewalk part takes 30 minutes.

So the total time is 60 minutes on the beach plus 30 minutes on the sidewalk. That adds up to 90 minutes. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, the problem says the entire 24-kilometer walk. The 12 km beach and 12 km sidewalk add up to 24 km, so that's correct. The speeds are given as twice on the sidewalk. So the beach time is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour, so speed 12 km/h. Then sidewalk speed is 24 km/h, so time is 12/24 = 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. Total time 60 + 30 = 90 minutes. Yeah, that seems right.

I think that's all. Let me just recap. Beach: 12 km at 12 km/h (60 min). Sidewalk: 12 km at 24 km/h (30 min). Total 90 minutes. Yep, that's the answer.
 
 Mia spends 60 minutes walking 12 kilometers on the beach. To determine her speed on the beach:
\[
\text{Speed}_{\text{beach}} = \frac{12\ \text{km}}{1\ \text{hour}} = 12\ \text{km/h}.
\]
Her sidewalk speed is twice this:
\[
\text{Speed}_{\text{sidewalk}} = 2 \times 12\ \text{km/h} = 24\ \text{km/h}.
\]
For the 12-kilometer sidewalk portion, the time taken is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{sidewalk}} = \frac{12\ \text{km}}{24\ \text{km/h}} = 0.5\ \text{hours} = 30\ \text{minutes}.
\]
Adding the beach and sidewalk times:
\[
\text{Total Time} = 60\ \text{minutes} + 30\ \text{minutes} = 90\ \text{minutes}.

18,"Bodhi went to buy some school supplies. He bought 22 rulers which cost ¥4.5 each, 8 colored pencils which cost ¥14.0 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost ¥22. How much did Bodhi spend on everything?",233,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Bodhi bought some school supplies, and I need to figure out how much he spent in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, he bought 22 rulers, each costing ¥4.5. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total cost for the rulers. That would be 22 multiplied by 4.5. Let me do that math. 22 times 4... that's 88, and 22 times 0.5 is 11. So adding those together, 88 + 11 equals 99. So the rulers cost ¥99 in total. Wait, let me check that again. 4.5 times 20 would be 90, and then 4.5 times 2 is 9, so 90 +9 is 99. Yeah, that's right.

Next, he bought 8 colored pencils at ¥14.0 each. So 8 multiplied by 14. Let's see, 10 times 14 is 140, but since it's 8, that's 140 minus 2 times 14, which is 28. So 140 -28 is 112. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 14 times 8: 10*8=80, 4*8=32, so 80+32=112. Yes, that's correct. So the colored pencils are ¥112.

Then there's the rim of bond paper which is ¥22. That's straightforward, just ¥22.

Now, adding all those amounts together: 99 (rulers) + 112 (pencils) + 22 (paper). Let's add them step by step. 99 + 112 is 211. Then 211 +22 is 233. So the total should be ¥233.

Wait, let me verify each calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Rulers: 22 *4.5. Let's do it another way. 4.5 is the same as 4 +0.5. So 22*4=88, 22*0.5=11. 88+11=99. Correct. Colored pencils: 14*8. 14*10 is 140, subtract 14*2=28, 140-28=112. Correct. Bond paper is 22. Adding 99+112: 99+100=199, then +12=211. Then 211+22=233. Yep, that adds up. So the total amount Bodhi spent is ¥233.
 
 Bodhi spent a total of ¥233 on school supplies. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Rulers**: 22 rulers × ¥4.5 each = ¥99  
   Calculation: \(22 \times 4.5 = 99\)

2. **Colored Pencils**: 8 pencils × ¥14.0 each = ¥112  
   Calculation: \(8 \times 14 = 112\)

3. **Bond Paper**: 1 rim × ¥22 = ¥22  

**Total Cost**: ¥99 (rulers) + ¥112 (pencils) + ¥22 (paper) = **¥233**

19,"In a 150-item quiz, 60% of the questions are history, and the rest are equally divided as literature and chemistry questions. If Mia is sure to get 40% of the history questions, and 1/10 of the literature and chemistry questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?",42,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about Mia's quiz points. Let me read it again carefully.

So, there's a 150-item quiz. 60% of the questions are history, and the rest are equally divided between literature and chemistry. Mia is sure to get 40% of the history questions right, and 1/10 of the literature and chemistry ones. How many points is she sure to get?

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step. First, figure out how many questions are in each category. Then calculate how many she gets right in each, and sum them up.

Starting with the total questions: 150. 60% are history. So, history questions = 60% of 150. Let me compute that. 60% is 0.6, so 0.6 * 150. Let's do 150 * 0.6. 150 times 0.6 is 90. So, 90 history questions.

The rest are literature and chemistry, equally divided. The rest would be 150 - 90 = 60 questions. Divided equally between literature and chemistry, so each has 60 / 2 = 30 questions. So, 30 literature and 30 chemistry.

Now, Mia's correct answers. For history, she gets 40% right. So 40% of 90. Let's calculate that. 40% is 0.4. 90 * 0.4 = 36. So she gets 36 history questions correct.

For literature and chemistry, she gets 1/10 of each. So 1/10 of 30 is 3. So 3 correct in literature and 3 in chemistry. Wait, but does the problem say 1/10 of each, or combined? Let me check the problem again. It says ""1/10 of the literature and chemistry questions correctly."" Hmm. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Are the literature and chemistry questions considered together, so 60 questions total, and she gets 1/10 of that? Or each separately?

The problem says ""the literature and chemistry questions"" so maybe each. Wait, the original split is 30 each. So if it's 1/10 of each, then 3 each. But if it's 1/10 of the total literature and chemistry combined (which is 60), then 6 total. Let me check the exact wording again.

The problem states: ""1/10 of the literature and chemistry questions correctly."" So ""literature and chemistry questions"" as a group. So total of 60 questions. 1/10 of 60 is 6. So she gets 6 correct from both categories combined. Wait, but maybe the problem is structured such that literature and chemistry are separate, each with 30, and she gets 1/10 of each. So 3 from literature and 3 from chemistry, totaling 6. Either way, the total would be 6. But let me make sure.

The problem says ""the rest are equally divided as literature and chemistry questions."" So rest is 60, divided equally into two, so 30 each. Then, ""1/10 of the literature and chemistry questions correctly."" So if it's 1/10 of each, then 3 each. But if it's 1/10 of the total (60), then 6. The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let's parse the sentence again.

""1/10 of the literature and chemistry questions correctly."" The way it's phrased, ""literature and chemistry questions"" is a plural noun, so ""1/10 of [the literature and chemistry questions]"". So the total number of literature and chemistry questions is 60. So 1/10 of 60 is 6. So she gets 6 correct from both combined. Wait, but maybe each subject's questions are considered separately. For example, 1/10 of literature (30) is 3, and 1/10 of chemistry (30) is 3, so total 6. Either way, the total is 6. So perhaps that's the same result. So regardless of interpretation, the total correct from literature and chemistry is 6.

But let me confirm. If the problem had said ""1/10 of the literature and 1/10 of the chemistry questions,"" then it's 3 each. But here it's written as ""1/10 of the literature and chemistry questions,"" which could mean 1/10 of each. But in standard phrasing, when you say ""1/10 of X and Y questions,"" where X and Y are separate categories, it's more likely that you take 1/10 of each. Otherwise, if they meant the total, they might say ""1/10 of the combined literature and chemistry questions."" Hmm. But perhaps the problem is structured so that each of literature and chemistry is 30, and she gets 1/10 of each. So 3 from each. So total 6. So either way, the answer would be 36 + 3 + 3 = 42, or 36 + 6 = 42. So same result. So maybe that's okay.

So moving forward. History: 36 correct. Literature and chemistry: 6 correct. Total points: 36 + 6 = 42. Wait, but points? The problem says ""how many points is she sure to get?"" Assuming each question is worth 1 point, then total correct answers would be the points. So 36 + 6 = 42. So the answer is 42.

Wait, but let me check again. Let's redo the steps to make sure.

Total questions: 150.

60% history: 0.6 * 150 = 90. Correct.

Remaining: 150 - 90 = 60. Divided equally into literature and chemistry: 30 each. Correct.

Mia's correct answers:

History: 40% of 90: 0.4 * 90 = 36. Correct.

Literature and chemistry: 1/10 of each. So 30 * 0.1 = 3 each. So 3 + 3 = 6. So total correct: 36 + 6 = 42. So 42 points.

Alternatively, if the 1/10 is applied to the total of literature and chemistry (60), then 60 * 0.1 = 6. So same result. So either way, 6. So total points 42.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 42.
 
 To determine how many points Mia is sure to get, we first calculate the number of questions in each category:

1. **History Questions**:  
   \(60\%\) of 150 items:  
   \(0.6 \times 150 = 90\) history questions.  

2. **Literature and Chemistry Questions**:  
   The remaining \(40\%\) (150 - 90 = 60) are split equally:  
   \(60 \div 2 = 30\) literature and 30 chemistry questions.  

Next, calculate Mia's correct answers:  

- **History**:  
  She gets \(40\%\) of 90 correct:  
  \(0.4 \times 90 = 36\) correct history answers.  

- **Literature and Chemistry**:  
  She gets \(\frac{1}{10}\) of each category:  
  \(30 \times \frac{1}{10} = 3\) correct in literature and \(30 \times \frac{1}{10} = 3\) in chemistry.  
  Total: \(3 + 3 = 6\) correct answers.  

**Total Points**:  
\(36\) (history) \(+ 6\) (literature and chemistry) \(= 42\) points.

20,"Liam picks 205 pineapples on Wednesday. Then he picks 97 pineapples on Thursday. On Friday, he picks quadruple the number of pineapples he did on Wednesday. How many pineapples does Liam have?",1122,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Liam picking pineapples over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The question is asking how many pineapples he has in total after those three days. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's note down the numbers given for each day. On Wednesday, he picks 205 pineapples. Then on Thursday, he picks 97. Then on Friday, it says he picks quadruple the number he did on Wednesday. Quadruple means four times, right? So Friday's amount is 4 multiplied by Wednesday's 205.

So the first thing I need to do is calculate Friday's pineapple count. Let me write that out. Wednesday is 205, Thursday is 97, Friday is 4 times 205. Let me compute that. 4 times 200 is 800, and 4 times 5 is 20, so 800 + 20 = 820. So Friday's total is 820 pineapples.

Now, to find the total, I need to add up all three days: Wednesday + Thursday + Friday. That would be 205 + 97 + 820. Let me add them step by step. Maybe first add Wednesday and Thursday together, then add Friday's amount.

Adding 205 and 97. Let's see, 200 + 90 is 290, and 5 + 7 is 12. So 290 + 12 = 302. So Wednesday and Thursday together are 302 pineapples. Then add Friday's 820 to that. 302 + 820. Breaking that down: 300 + 800 is 1100, and 2 + 20 is 22. So 1100 + 22 = 1122. Wait, that seems right. Let me check again.

Alternatively, adding 205 + 97 first. 205 + 95 would be 300, but he has 97, which is 2 more than 95. So 205 + 95 = 300, plus 2 is 302. Then 302 + 820. Let's add 300 + 820 = 1120, then add the remaining 2: 1120 + 2 = 1122. Yep, same result.

So the total number of pineapples Liam has is 1122. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's verify each step again.

Wednesday: 205. Thursday: 97. Friday: 4*205 = 820. Correct. Then 205 + 97. Let's do it another way. 205 + 100 would be 305, but since it's 97, subtract 3: 305 -3 = 302. That's correct. Then 302 + 820. 300 + 800 = 1100, 2 + 20 = 22. 1100 +22 = 1122. Yep, that's right. So all steps check out. The answer should be 1122.
 
 Liam's pineapple count over three days is calculated as follows:

- **Wednesday**: 205 pineapples  
- **Thursday**: 97 pineapples  
- **Friday**: Quadruple of Wednesday’s count = \(4 \times 205 = 820\) pineapples  

**Total** = Wednesday + Thursday + Friday  
= \(205 + 97 + 820\)  
= \(302 + 820\) (after adding 205 + 97)  
= **1,122 pineapples**

Okay, let's see. Benjamin watches TV every night after homework. The problem is asking how many 45-minute episodes he watched on Thursday. The total TV time for the week is 23 hours. So I need to calculate the time he spent each day and then find out what's left for Thursday.

First, let's break down each day:

Tuesday and Wednesday: Each night he watched a 4-hour episode. So that's 4 hours each day. So 4 + 4 = 8 hours for Tuesday and Wednesday combined.

Friday: He watched a 6-hour episode and a 15-minute show. Let's convert that to hours. 6 hours plus 15 minutes. Since 15 minutes is 0.25 hours (because 15/60 = 0.25), so total for Friday is 6.25 hours.

Saturday: Two 4-hour episodes. That's 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's sum up all these days except Thursday.

Tuesday + Wednesday: 8 hours
Friday: 6.25 hours
Saturday: 8 hours
Total so far: 8 + 6.25 + 8 = 22.25 hours.

The total for the week is 23 hours. So the remaining time for Thursday is 23 - 22.25 = 0.75 hours. Wait, 0.75 hours is 45 minutes. Because 0.75 * 60 = 45 minutes. Oh, so on Thursday, he watched 45 minutes total. But each episode is 45 minutes. So that would mean he watched 1 episode. Hmm, but wait, the problem says ""a few episodes of a 45-minute show"". So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again. Let me recalculate the total.

Tuesday: 4 hours
Wednesday: 4 hours
Thursday: X episodes * 0.75 hours each (since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours)
Friday: 6 + 0.25 = 6.25 hours
Saturday: 4*2=8 hours

Total time: 4 + 4 + (0.75 * X) + 6.25 + 8 = 23

Adding up the known hours: 4 + 4 = 8, plus 6.25 is 14.25, plus 8 is 22.25. So 22.25 + 0.75X = 23. Subtract 22.25 from both sides: 0.75X = 0.75. Then X = 1. So he watched 1 episode on Thursday. But the problem says ""a few episodes"". Hmm, maybe ""a few"" here is just used to indicate some, not necessarily multiple. So the answer is 1. Let me confirm.

Wait, maybe I converted the minutes wrong. Let's check:

45 minutes is 0.75 hours. So each episode is 0.75 hours. So if he watched X episodes, that's 0.75X hours. The total from other days is 22.25 hours, so 22.25 + 0.75X = 23. Solving for X: 0.75X = 0.75 → X=1. So yes, 1 episode. So the answer is 1.
 
 Benjamin's total TV time for the week is 23 hours. Calculating the time spent each day:

- **Tuesday & Wednesday**: 4 hours each night → 4 + 4 = **8 hours**
- **Friday**: 6 hours + 15 minutes (0.25 hours) → **6.25 hours**
- **Saturday**: Two 4-hour episodes → 4 × 2 = **8 hours**

Summing these:  
8 (Tue/Wed) + 6.25 (Fri) + 8 (Sat) = **22.25 hours**

Time remaining for Thursday:  
23 total − 22.25 = **0.75 hours** (which equals 45 minutes).

Each 45-minute episode is **0.75 hours**. Thus, the number of episodes watched on Thursday:  
0.75 hours ÷ 0.75 hours/episode = **1 episode**.

**Answer:** Benjamin watched **1** 45-minute episode on Thursday.",True
22,"Emma was preparing for a game night at her house, where she intended to serve stuffed peppers. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a package of 18 new spoons and gave them to Emma. While Emma was making the stuffed peppers, she used ten of the spoons to sample her stuffed peppers. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 30 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Emma bought?",22,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many spoons were in the package that Emma bought. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. 

So, Emma initially didn't have any plastic spoons because she was out. Then she bought a new package. Let's call the number of spoons in that package ""x"". Later, her husband bought another package with 18 spoons and gave them to her. So, in total, Emma added two packages: one with x spoons and another with 18 spoons. 

But then, while making the stuffed peppers, she used ten spoons to sample her food. So those ten spoons were used up, right? That means she subtracted ten from her total. 

After all that, when she went to set the table, she had 30 spoons left. The question is asking for the value of x, the number of spoons in the package she bought.

Let me put this into an equation. The total spoons she had would be the sum of her package and her husband's package, minus the ten she used. So:

x (Emma's package) + 18 (husband's package) - 10 (used) = 30 (remaining)

So, x + 18 - 10 = 30. Simplifying that, 18 -10 is 8, so x + 8 = 30. Then, subtract 8 from both sides: x = 30 -8. That gives x = 22. 

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. If Emma bought 22 spoons, her husband added 18, so total before using any would be 22 +18 =40. Then she used 10, so 40 -10 =30. Yep, that matches the final count. So the answer should be 22.
 
 Emma started with no spoons. Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package she bought. Her husband added 18 spoons. Emma then used 10 spoons, leaving her with 30. The equation is:

\[
x + 18 - 10 = 30
\]

Simplifying:

\[
x + 8 = 30 \implies x = 30 - 8 = 22
\]

**Answer:** The package Emma bought contained 22 spoons.",True
23,"Amelia is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a vest, shawl, beanie, socks, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 17 skeins of wool to make a vest, 11 for a shawl, 18 for a beanie, 12 for a pair of socks, and 6 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",128,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Amelia is making winter wear for her two twin grandchildren. She wants to make a vest, shawl, beanie, socks, and leg warmers for each of them. So first, I need to figure out how many items she's making in total and then calculate the total skeins required.

Wait, each child gets each of those items. So per child, that's 1 vest, 1 shawl, 1 beanie, 1 pair of socks, and 1 pair of leg warmers. Since there are two grandchildren, she needs to make two of each item.

Let me list out the items and their required skeins:

- Vest: 17 skeins each
- Shawl: 11 skeins each
- Beanie: 18 skeins each
- Socks: 12 skeins per pair
- Leg warmers: 6 skeins per pair

So for each child, the total skeins would be the sum of all these. Let's compute that first.

Calculating per child:
17 (vest) + 11 (shawl) + 18 (beanie) + 12 (socks) + 6 (leg warmers) = ?

Let me add them step by step. 17 + 11 is 28. Then 28 + 18 is 46. 46 + 12 is 58. 58 + 6 is 64. So each child needs 64 skeins.

But wait, since there are two children, we need to multiply this by 2. So 64 * 2 = 128 skeins total.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the addition. Let me add the numbers again:

17 (vest)
+11 (shawl) = 28
+18 (beanie) = 46
+12 (socks) = 58
+6 (leg warmers) = 64. Yes, that's correct per child.

Two children: 64 * 2 = 128. So Amelia needs to buy 128 skeins of wool in total.

Alternatively, another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of each item needed and then multiply by the skeins per item.

For example, she needs 2 vests. Each vest is 17 skeins. So 2 * 17 = 34 skeins for vests.

Similarly, 2 shawls: 2 * 11 = 22.

2 beanies: 2 * 18 = 36.

2 pairs of socks: 2 * 12 = 24.

2 pairs of leg warmers: 2 * 6 = 12.

Now add all these together: 34 + 22 + 36 + 24 + 12.

Let's compute that step by step:

34 + 22 = 56

56 + 36 = 92

92 + 24 = 116

116 + 12 = 128. Same result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Amelia needs to buy is 128.
 
 Amelia needs to create a set of winter wear items for each of her two grandchildren. Each set includes a vest, shawl, beanie, socks, and leg warmers. Here's the breakdown:

**Skeins per item:**
- Vest: 17
- Shawl: 11
- Beanie: 18
- Socks (pair): 12
- Leg Warmers (pair): 6

**Calculations per child:**
\[
17 + 11 + 18 + 12 + 6 = 64 \text{ skeins}
\]

**Total for two children:**
\[
64 \times 2 = 128 \text{ skeins}
\]

**Alternative verification by item totals:**
- Vests: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
- Shawls: \(2 \times 11 = 22\)
- Beanies: \(2 \times 18 = 36\)
- Socks: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)
- Leg Warmers: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

**Summing all items:**
\[
34 + 22 + 36 + 24 + 12 = 128 \text{ skeins}

24,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 475 calories per serving. If a 275 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2395 and you have already consumed 1350 calories?",121,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many ounces of bread someone can eat given their daily calorie target. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the problem states that a bag of bread has 475 calories per serving. The bag is 275 ounces and contains 5 servings. The person's daily calorie target is 2395, and they've already consumed 1350 calories. So, I need to find out how many ounces they can eat without exceeding their remaining calories.

Let me start by calculating the remaining calories they can consume. They've had 1350 already, so subtracting that from 2395 gives the remaining calories. Let me do that math: 2395 minus 1350. Hmm, 2395 - 1000 is 1395, then subtract 350 more, which would be 1395 - 350 = 1045. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2395 - 1350. Let's do it digit by digit. 2395 minus 1350. 2000 - 1000 is 1000, 300 - 300 is 0, 95 - 50 is 45. So total remaining is 1000 + 45 = 1045 calories left. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, each serving of the bread is 475 calories. So how many servings can they have with 1045 calories? Let's divide 1045 by 475. Let me see. 475 times 2 is 950. 1045 minus 950 is 95. So that's 2 servings (950 calories) and then 95 calories left. But since each serving is 475, they can't have a third serving because that would be 475, which is more than 95. So they can have 2 full servings, which uses up 950 calories, leaving 95 calories unused. But maybe the question allows partial servings? Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether they can eat a fraction of a serving or only whole servings. Hmm. That's a good point. Let me check the problem statement again. It says ""how many ounces can you eat"" without specifying whole servings, so maybe partial is allowed. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So total calories allowed: 1045. Each serving is 475 calories. So the number of servings is 1045 / 475. Let me calculate that. 475 goes into 1045 how many times? 475 * 2 = 950, as before. 1045 - 950 = 95. So 95 calories left. So 95 / 475 = 0.2. So total servings would be 2.2. So 2.2 servings.

Now, each serving is part of the 275 ounces bag that has 5 servings. So first, find out how many ounces per serving. If 5 servings are in 275 ounces, then one serving is 275 / 5 ounces. Let me compute that. 275 divided by 5. 5 * 50 is 250, so 50 ounces with 25 left. 25 divided by 5 is 5. So 50 +5 =55. So each serving is 55 ounces. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5 servings in 275 ounces. So 275 ounces per bag divided by 5 servings equals 55 ounces per serving. Wait, that seems like a lot. 55 ounces per serving? Because 275 ounces divided by 5 is 55. But 55 ounces is like over 3 pounds. That seems very high for a serving size. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says a 275 ounces bag has 5 servings. So each serving is 275 /5 ounces. 275 divided by 5. 5 times 50 is 250, so 50 ounces, then 25 left. 25 divided by 5 is 5. So 50 +5=55. So each serving is 55 ounces. But that's 55 ounces per serving. But 55 ounces is a lot. For example, a typical slice of bread is about an ounce. So 55 ounces would be like 55 slices. But maybe this is a different kind of bread, like a large bag of rolls or something. Anyway, perhaps the problem is correct as given, so I'll proceed with that.

So each serving is 55 ounces. Therefore, if they can have 2.2 servings, then the total ounces would be 55 * 2.2. Let's compute that. 55 * 2 is 110. 55 * 0.2 is 11. So 110 +11=121 ounces. So 121 ounces is the amount they can eat without exceeding their calorie target.

Wait, but let me confirm the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recap:

1. Remaining calories: 2395 - 1350 = 1045.
2. Calories per serving: 475.
3. Number of servings possible: 1045 /475 = 2.2.
4. Ounces per serving: 275 /5 =55.
5. Total ounces: 55 *2.2 =121.

Yes, that seems correct. But let me check the ounces per serving again. If the entire bag is 275 ounces and has 5 servings, then each serving is 275/5=55 ounces. So that's correct. So 2.2 servings would be 55 *2.2=121 ounces. So the answer is 121 ounces.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's see. Let's find out how many calories per ounce. Since the bag is 275 ounces and has 5 servings, each serving is 55 ounces as before. Each serving is 475 calories. So calories per ounce would be 475 /55. Let me compute that. 475 divided by 55. 55*8=440. 475-440=35. So 8. So 8.636... calories per ounce. So then, if they have 1045 calories left, they can eat 1045 / (475/55) ounces. Let's compute that. 1045 divided by (475/55) is the same as 1045 * (55/475). Let's simplify. 1045 and 475. Let's see if they have a common factor. 475 is 25*19. 1045 divided by 5 is 209. 209 divided by 19 is 11. So 1045 =5*19*11. 475=5*5*19. So common factors are 5 and 19. So 1045/475 = (5*19*11)/(5*5*19) )= 11/5 = 2.2. So 1045/475 =2.2. Then multiply by 55: 2.2 *55=121. So same result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 121 ounces.
 
 To determine how many ounces of bread can be consumed without exceeding the daily calorie target, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate remaining calories:**
   \[
   2395 \text{ (daily target)} - 1350 \text{ (consumed)} = 1045 \text{ calories remaining}
   \]

2. **Determine servings allowed:**
   Each serving is 475 calories. The number of servings possible with 1045 calories is:
   \[
   \frac{1045}{475} = 2.2 \text{ servings (including partial servings)}
   \]

3. **Find ounces per serving:**
   The 275-ounce bag contains 5 servings, so:
   \[
   \frac{275 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 55 \text{ ounces per serving}
   \]

4. **Calculate total ounces allowed:**
   Multiply the number of servings by ounces per serving:
   \[
   2.2 \text{ servings} \times 55 \text{ ounces/serving} = 121 \text{ ounces}
   \]

**Final Answer:** You can eat **121 ounces** of bread without exceeding your calorie target.",True
25,"In Mr. Smith's class of 35 students, 20% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are dancers or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?",14,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Mr. Smith's class which has 35 students. We need to find out how many students are leaving early for the tournament. The groups leaving are the basketball players, dancers, and robotics club members. 

First, the problem says 20% of the class are basketball players. So I should calculate 20% of 35. Let me do that. 20% is the same as 0.2, so 35 multiplied by 0.2. Let me compute that: 35 * 0.2 = 7. So there are 7 basketball players.

Now, the remaining class after the basketball players are taken out. The total is 35, so subtracting the 7 basketball players gives 35 - 7 = 28 students remaining. 

Out of these 28, 25% are dancers or part of the robotics club. Wait, the problem says 25% of the remaining class are in either of those two groups. So I need to find 25% of 28. 25% is 0.25, so 28 * 0.25. Let me calculate that: 28 * 0.25 is 7. So there are 7 students who are dancers or robotics club members.

So the total number of students leaving early would be the basketball players plus the dancers/robotics club members. That's 7 + 7 = 14 students. 

Wait, let me double-check. The problem says ""out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are dancers or part of robotics club members."" So that 25% is applied to the remaining 28 students after removing the basketball players. So 25% of 28 is indeed 7. Adding that to the original 7 basketball players gives 14. 

Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem mentions three groups: basketball players, dancers, and robotics club. But the 25% is for dancers OR robotics club members. Are dancers and robotics club separate groups, or combined? The problem says ""dancers or part of robotics club members,"" so it's the union of those two groups. So the 25% includes any student who is in either group. So even if some are in both, but since percentages are given, we don't need to consider overlaps here. So the total number is 7 (basketball) + 7 (dancers + robotics) = 14. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be 14 students leaving early.
 
 To determine how many students are leaving early, we break down the problem step by step:

1. **Basketball Players**:  
   20% of 35 students are basketball players.  
   \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \) students.

2. **Remaining Students**:  
   Subtract the basketball players from the total:  
   \( 35 - 7 = 28 \) students remaining.

3. **Dancers or Robotics Club Members**:  
   25% of the remaining 28 students are in these groups.  
   \( 28 \times 0.25 = 7 \) students.

4. **Total Students Leaving Early**:  
   Add basketball players and dancers/robotics members:  
   \( 7 + 7 = 14 \).

**Answer:** 14 students are leaving early.",True
26,"A grandfather eats 6 tacos per day, his partner eats 3 tacos per day, and their son eats 6 tacos per day. How many tacos does this family eat in one week?",105,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many tacos a family eats in a week. The family consists of a grandfather, his partner, and their son. Each of them eats a certain number of tacos per day, and we need to find the total for a week.

First, I need to figure out how many tacos each person eats in a day and then sum them up. Then multiply that daily total by 7 days to get the weekly consumption. Let me break it down step by step.

The grandfather eats 6 tacos a day. His partner eats 3 tacos a day. Their son also eats 6 tacos a day. So, the three people are grandfather, partner, son. Wait, the problem says ""their son""—so the grandfather and his partner have a son. So that's three family members total.

So per day, each person's taco consumption is:

Grandfather: 6 tacos/day
Partner: 3 tacos/day
Son: 6 tacos/day

Adding those together for the daily total. Let's calculate that. 6 + 3 is 9, and then plus another 6 makes 15. So 15 tacos per day for the whole family.

Now, to find out how much they eat in a week, which is 7 days. So multiply the daily total by 7. 15 tacos/day * 7 days = 105 tacos.

Wait, let me check that again. Let me add the numbers step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Grandfather is 6, partner is 3, son is 6. 6 + 3 is 9, then 9 +6 is 15. Yes, that's correct. So 15 per day. Then 15 times 7. Let's compute that. 15*7: 10*7 is 70, 5*7 is 35, so 70+35=105. Yep, that's right.

So the family eats 105 tacos in one week. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no trick or anything here. The problem seems straightforward—sum each person's daily intake, multiply by 7. No hidden members or anything. The family is three people as per the description. So yeah, 105 should be correct.
 
 The family consists of three members: the grandfather (6 tacos/day), his partner (3 tacos/day), and their son (6 tacos/day). 

**Daily Total:**  
6 (grandfather) + 3 (partner) + 6 (son) = **15 tacos/day**

27,Sanjay receives 150 emails a day. 32% of those emails don't require any response. Sanjay responds to the rest of them. How many emails does Sanjay respond to in a 6 day work week?,612,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Sanjay gets 150 emails each day. Out of those, 32% don't need a response. That means the rest, which would be 100% minus 32%, he does have to respond to. Let me break this down step by step.

First, calculate the percentage of emails that require a response. If 32% don't need it, then 100% - 32% = 68% do. So each day, 68% of 150 emails are ones he responds to.

Now, let's find out how many emails that is per day. To calculate 68% of 150, I can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. So 68% is 0.68. Then multiply 150 by 0.68. Let me do that math. 150 times 0.68. Hmm, 150 times 0.6 is 90, and 150 times 0.08 is 12. Adding those together gives 90 + 12 = 102. So Sanjay responds to 102 emails each day.

But wait, the question is asking for a 6-day work week. So I need to multiply the daily responses by 6. That would be 102 emails/day * 6 days. Let me compute that. 100*6 is 600, and 2*6 is 12. So 600 + 12 = 612. 

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The percentage calculation: 32% no response, so 68% response. 150 * 0.68. Let's do it another way. 10% of 150 is 15, so 60% is 90. 8% is 12. So 90 +12 is 102. Yep, that's right. Then 102 *6. Breaking it down: 100*6=600, 2*6=12. Total 612. That seems correct. 

I think that's all. So the answer should be 612 emails over six days.
 
 Sanjay receives 150 emails daily, with 32% not requiring a response. This means **68%** (100% - 32%) of the emails need replies.  

**Daily Responses:**  
68% of 150 emails = \( 150 \times 0.68 = 102 \) emails per day.  

**Weekly Responses (6 days):**

28,"A clinic has a capacity of 1800 rooms with 1/4 occupied. Due to the natural disaster, 40 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 3 weeks.",510,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about a clinic with a certain number of rooms, some occupied, and then patients being admitted daily due to a natural disaster. We need to find the number of unoccupied rooms after three weeks. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the clinic has a capacity of 1800 rooms. Initially, 1/4 of them are occupied. So, let me calculate how many rooms are occupied at the start. If 1/4 of 1800 are occupied, that's 1800 divided by 4. Let me do that: 1800 ÷ 4 = 450. So, 450 rooms are occupied initially. That means the number of unoccupied rooms at the beginning is 1800 - 450 = 1350. Got that part.

Now, due to the natural disaster, 40 patients are admitted each day. Wait, each day they add 40 patients. But each patient would occupy a room, right? So each day, 40 more rooms get occupied. But we need to track this over three weeks. Three weeks is 21 days, right? Because 7 days a week, 3 times 7 is 21.

So over 21 days, the number of new patients admitted would be 40 patients/day multiplied by 21 days. Let me calculate that: 40 × 21. Let's see, 40×20 is 800, plus 40×1 is 40, so total 840. So 840 new patients are admitted over three weeks. Each patient takes a room, so that's 840 rooms occupied additionally.

But wait, we need to check if the total number of occupied rooms exceeds the clinic's capacity. Because if they admit more patients than there are rooms, the unoccupied rooms can't be negative. Let's see. The initial occupied rooms were 450. Adding 840 would make 450 + 840 = 1290 occupied rooms. The clinic's total capacity is 1800. So 1290 is less than 1800. Therefore, all these patients can be accommodated, and the unoccupied rooms would be 1800 - 1290.

Wait, let me verify that again. Initial occupied: 450. New patients over 21 days: 40 per day ×21 days = 840. Total occupied after three weeks: 450 + 840 = 1290. Total rooms: 1800. So unoccupied rooms would be 1800 - 1290 = 510. So the answer should be 510 unoccupied rooms.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says ""due to the natural disaster, 40 patients are admitted into the clinic each day."" So each day, 40 new patients come in. So over 21 days, that's 40×21=840. Adding to the initial 450, gives 1290. Subtract from total capacity: 1800-1290=510. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the initial occupancy is 1/4, and then each day 40 are added. But perhaps the initial 1/4 is patients, and each new patient adds to that. But the calculation seems the same. Let me check again.

Total rooms: 1800. Initially occupied: 1/4 of 1800 is 450. Then, each day, 40 more are occupied. After 3 weeks (21 days), the number of new occupied rooms is 40×21=840. Total occupied: 450+840=1290. Unoccupied: 1800-1290=510. Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 510.
 
 The clinic has a total capacity of 1800 rooms. Initially, 1/4 of these rooms are occupied:  
\[
\text{Occupied initially} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1800 = 450 \text{ rooms}
\]  
Unoccupied rooms at the start:  
\[
1800 - 450 = 1350 \text{ rooms}
\]  

Over 3 weeks (21 days), 40 new patients are admitted daily, occupying additional rooms:  
\[
\text{New occupied rooms} = 40 \times 21 = 840 \text{ rooms}
\]  

Total occupied rooms after 3 weeks:  
\[
450 + 840 = 1290 \text{ rooms}
\]  

Unoccupied rooms remaining:  
\[
1800 - 1290 = 510 \text{ rooms}
\]  

**Final Answer:**  
The total number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks is \boxed{510}.",True
29,Pavel is 13 years old. In 3 years his sister Valentina will be 3 times as old as Pavel is now. How old is Valentina right now?,36,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about Pavel and his sister Valentina's ages. Hmm. So Pavel is currently 13 years old. The question is asking how old Valentina is right now. Let me parse the information step by step.

First, the problem states: In 3 years, Valentina will be 3 times as old as Pavel is now. Wait, Pavel is now 13. So in three years, Valentina's age will be 3 times Pavel's current age. Let me write that down.

So currently, Pavel is 13. In three years, Valentina's age = 3 * Pavel's current age. That would be 3 * 13 = 39. So in three years, Valentina will be 39. Therefore, right now, her age is 39 minus 3 years. Let me check that.

Wait, if in three years she's 39, then now she's 39 - 3 = 36. That seems straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The key part is ""in 3 years his sister Valentina will be 3 times as old as Pavel is now."" So ""as Pavel is now"" refers to Pavel's current age, which is 13. So 3 times that is 39. Then subtract the three years to get her current age. So Valentina is 36 now.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes these age problems can be tricky with the timing. Let me rephrase the problem. Right now, Pavel is 13. In three years, Valentina's age will be three times Pavel's current age. So three times Pavel's current age is 39. So in three years, Valentina is 39. Therefore, right now, she's 39 - 3 = 36. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be 36. Let me check if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, let's set up equations. Let V be Valentina's current age. In three years, her age will be V + 3. According to the problem, that equals 3 times Pavel's current age. Pavel's current age is 13. So:

V + 3 = 3 * 13

V + 3 = 39

Subtract 3 from both sides:

V = 39 - 3 = 36

Yep, that confirms it. So Valentina is currently 36 years old. I think that's correct. The key was to recognize that the 3 times refers to Pavel's current age, not his future age. So even though the event is in three years, the multiplier is based on Pavel's present age. So the calculation is straightforward once you set up the equation correctly.
 
 Valentina's current age can be determined by setting up an equation based on the given information. 

1. **Current Age of Pavel**: 13 years old.
2. **Future Age Relationship**: In 3 years, Valentina's age will be 3 times Pavel's current age (13).  
   - In 3 years, Valentina's age = \( 3 \times 13 = 39 \).
3. **Current Age Calculation**: Subtract the 3-year difference to find Valentina's current age.  
   - Valentina's current age = \( 39 - 3 = 36 \).

**Answer**: Valentina is currently 36 years old.",True
30,Yusuf has ₣102.5 and wants to buy 25 washers from a bin at the construction supply store. Each washer costs ₣0.98. How much money does Yusuf have left after paying for the washers?,78,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Yusuf has 102.5 francs and wants to buy 25 washers. Each washer costs 0.98 francs. I need to find out how much money he has left after the purchase.

First, I should calculate the total cost of the washers. Since each is 0.98 and he's buying 25, I multiply 25 by 0.98. Let me do that step by step. 25 times 0.98... Hmm, maybe breaking it down would help. 25 times 1 would be 25, but since it's 0.98, that's 25 times (1 - 0.02). So 25*1 is 25, and 25*0.02 is 0.5. Subtracting that gives 25 - 0.5 = 24.5. So the total cost is 24.5 francs.

Wait, let me check that again. 25 multiplied by 0.98. Alternatively, 0.98 is almost 1, so 25*1 is 25, minus 25*0.02. 0.02 times 25 is 0.5. So yes, 25 - 0.5 is 24.5. That seems right.

Now, Yusuf started with 102.5 francs. Subtract the total cost of 24.5 francs from that. So 102.5 minus 24.5. Let's compute that. 102.5 - 24.5. The .5 parts cancel out, so 102 - 24 is 78. So he has 78 francs left.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in subtraction. 102.5 minus 24.5. Let's do it as 102.5 - 20 = 82.5, then subtract 4.5 more. 82.5 - 4 = 78.5, then minus 0.5 is 78.0. Yes, that's correct. So the remaining money is 78 francs.

So the steps are: calculate total cost (25 * 0.98 = 24.5), subtract that from initial amount (102.5 - 24.5 = 78). Therefore, Yusuf has 78 francs left.
 
 Yusuf starts with ₣102.5. To determine how much he spends on 25 washers at ₣0.98 each:

1. **Calculate total cost**:  
   \( 25 \times 0.98 = 24.5 \) francs.  
   (Breaking down: \( 25 \times 1 = 25 \), subtract \( 25 \times 0.02 = 0.5 \), so \( 25 - 0.5 = 24.5 \).)

2. **Subtract cost from initial amount**:  
   \( 102.5 - 24.5 = 78 \) francs.

**Answer**: Yusuf has ₣78 left after purchasing the washers.",True
31,"Mateo and Santiago are currently 10 years apart in age. If Mateo, who is younger than Santiago, is 35 years old, what's the average of their ages?",40,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem says Mateo and Santiago are 10 years apart in age. Mateo is younger than Santiago, and Mateo is 35. We need to find the average of their ages.

First, since Mateo is younger, Santiago must be older. The age difference is 10 years. So if Mateo is 35, Santiago would be 35 plus 10. That makes Santiago 45 years old. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. If they're 10 years apart, and Mateo is the younger one, adding 10 to Mateo's age gives Santiago's age. So 35 +10 =45. So Santiago is 45.

Now, to find the average of their ages. The average is calculated by adding both ages together and dividing by 2. So 35 plus 45 is 80. Then divide by 2, which gives 40. So the average age would be 40. Hmm, that seems right. Let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem states they are 10 years apart, and since Mateo is younger, the calculation is straightforward. No mention of any other factors like future or past ages, just current ages. So yes, the average should be 40.
 
 Mateo is 35 years old and younger than Santiago. Since their age difference is 10 years, Santiago's age is \(35 + 10 = 45\) years. 

To find the average of their ages:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{35 + 45}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40

**Answer:** The average of their ages is \(\boxed{40}\).",True
32,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $360000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $340000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Mrs. Lee's budget?",24200,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Mrs. Lee has a budget of $360,000, and she found a townhouse that's priced at $340,000. But there are additional fees: a brokerage fee of 3% of the selling price and a transfer fee of 10% of the selling price. I need to figure out the total cost and see how much over her budget that is.

First, let's break down the selling price and the fees. The selling price is straightforward—$340,000. Then the brokerage fee is 3% of that. To calculate 3% of 340,000, I can multiply 340,000 by 0.03. Let me do that. 340,000 * 0.03 equals... let's see, 340,000 divided by 100 is 3,400, so 3 times that is 10,200. So the brokerage fee is $10,200.

Next, the transfer fee is 10% of the selling price. That's 10% of 340,000. 10% is easy because you just move the decimal one place. So 10% of 340,000 is 34,000. So transfer fee is $34,000.

Now, adding all these together: the selling price plus brokerage plus transfer fee. So 340,000 + 10,200 + 34,000. Let's add them step by step. 340,000 + 10,200 is 350,200. Then add 34,000 to that. 350,200 + 34,000 equals 384,200. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. 340k plus 10k is 350k, then 350k plus 34k would be 384k. Oh right, but the brokerage was 10,200, so 340k + 10.2k is 350.2k, then adding 34k gives 384.2k. So total cost is $384,200.

Mrs. Lee's budget is $360,000. So the difference is 384,200 minus 360,000. Let's subtract. 384,200 - 360,000 = 24,200. So the total price is $24,200 over her budget. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify once more.

Selling price: 340,000. 3% brokerage: 340,000 * 0.03 = 10,200. 10% transfer: 340,000 * 0.10 = 34,000. Total: 340k + 10.2k + 34k = 340k + 44.2k = 384.2k. Budget is 360k. 384.2k - 360k = 24.2k. Yep, that's $24,200. So Mrs. Lee would need $24,200 more than her budget to buy this townhouse.
 
 The total cost of the townhouse includes the selling price plus a 3% brokerage fee and a 10% transfer fee. 

1. **Selling Price**: $340,000  
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 3% of $340,000 = $10,200  
3. **Transfer Fee**: 10% of $340,000 = $34,000  

**Total Cost** = $340,000 + $10,200 + $34,000 = **$384,200**  

Mrs. Lee's budget is **$360,000**.  

**Amount Over Budget** = $384,200 - $360,000 = **$24,200**

The sisters have 2 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 120 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?",55,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Daphne and Uma are sisters collecting signatures. They want to reach a total of 120 signatures together by the end of their winter break. Right now, Daphne has 35 and Uma has 30. So first, I need to figure out how many they have in total already. Let me add those two numbers. 35 plus 30 is 65. So together they have 65 signatures so far.

But wait, the problem says they have 2 more weeks of winter break. So they want to collect enough in those two weeks to reach 120 total. So the next step is to subtract the current total from the goal to find out how many more they need. Let's do that. 120 minus 65 equals... let's see, 120 minus 60 is 60, then minus 5 more is 55. So they need 55 more signatures combined in the next two weeks.

Wait, but the question is asking how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal. So the answer should be 55. Let me double-check. Current total is 35 +30=65. Goal is 120. 120-65=55. Yeah, that seems right. So they need to collect 55 more signatures together. The problem doesn't specify if they need to split them between the sisters or if it's a combined total, so the answer is 55.
 
 The sisters currently have a combined total of 35 (Daphne) + 30 (Uma) = 65 signatures. Their goal is 120 signatures. Subtracting their current total from the goal gives 120 - 65 = 55. Therefore, Daphne and Uma need to collect **55 more signatures** together in the remaining 2 weeks to reach their target.

34,"Prof. Martinez sold his cottage for $880000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $440000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Prof. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the cottage?",369600,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Prof. Martinez selling his cottage and figuring out his net proceeds. Hmm. Net proceeds usually mean the amount he gets after all the expenses are subtracted from the selling price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the selling price is $880,000. Then there are some fees he has to pay. The registration fees are 3% of the selling price. Oh right, percentages. So 3% of 880,000. Let me calculate that. 3% is 0.03 in decimal, so 880,000 multiplied by 0.03. Let me do that: 880,000 * 0.03 = 26,400. So registration fees are $26,400.

Next, the agent fee is 5% of the selling price. Again, 5% is 0.05. So 880,000 * 0.05. Let's compute that. 880,000 * 0.05 = 44,000. So agent fee is $44,000.

Then he also paid $440,000 for the remaining loan amount. So that's another expense.

So all the expenses are registration fees, agent fee, and the loan repayment. The net proceeds would be the selling price minus all these expenses.

Let me add up all the expenses first. Registration ($26,400) + agent fee ($44,000) + loan ($440,000). Let's add them step by step. 26,400 + 44,000 is 70,400. Then adding 440,000 to that gives 70,400 + 440,000 = 510,400. So total expenses are $510,400.

Now subtract that from the selling price. 880,000 - 510,400. Let's compute that. 880,000 minus 500,000 is 380,000. Then subtract the remaining 10,400: 380,000 - 10,400 = 369,600. Wait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let's see: 880,000 minus 510,400. 

Starting from 880,000:

Subtract 500,000: 380,000.

Then subtract 10,400: 380,000 - 10,000 = 370,000. Then subtract 400 more: 370,000 - 400 = 369,600. Yeah, that's correct. So the net proceeds would be $369,600.

Wait, let me check all the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Selling price: 880k. 

3% registration: 0.03*880k = 26,400. Correct.

5% agent fee: 0.05*880k = 44,000. Correct.

Loan repayment: 440k. 

Total expenses: 26,400 + 44,000 = 70,400. Then 70,400 + 440,000 = 510,400. Correct.

Subtracting from 880k: 880,000 - 510,400. Let's do it another way. 510,400 is 500k + 10,400. So 880k - 500k = 380k. Then 380k - 10,400 = 369,600. Yep, that's right.

So the net proceeds should be $369,600. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other fees or costs mentioned. The problem mentions registration fees, agent fee, and the remaining loan. So those are all the deductions. So yes, the calculation seems correct.
 
 Prof. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the cottage are calculated by subtracting all expenses from the selling price. 

1. **Selling Price**: $880,000

Okay, let's see. So Wei is trying to raise money for a conference. The problem says that the local charity is covering a fifth of the cost. He already has 30 francs, and the conference costs 210 francs. We need to find out how much more money he's missing.

First, let me break down the problem step by step. The total cost is 210 francs. The charity is paying for one-fifth of that. So I should calculate what one-fifth of 210 is. To find a fifth of something, you divide it by 5. So 210 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation. 210 ÷ 5 equals... let's see, 5 times 40 is 200, so 40 with 10 left over. 10 divided by 5 is 2. So 40 + 2 is 42. So the charity is contributing 42 francs.

Now, Wei himself has 30 francs. So between the charity and his own money, how much do they cover? That would be 42 (charity) plus 30 (Wei's money) equals 72 francs total covered so far.

The total cost is 210, so the remaining amount needed is 210 minus 72. Let me compute that. 210 - 70 is 140, then subtract 2 more gives 138. Wait, no. Wait, 210 minus 72. Let me do it properly. 210 - 70 is 140, but since it's 72, subtract another 2, so 140 - 2 = 138. So 138 francs still needed.

Wait, but let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in subtraction. Let's see: 210 minus 72. Starting from the units place: 0 minus 2, can't do that, so borrow from the tens. The 1 in the tens place becomes 0, and the 0 in the units becomes 10. Then 10 - 2 = 8. Then the tens place: 0 (after borrowing) minus 7. Again, can't do that, so borrow from the hundreds place. The 2 becomes 1, and the tens place becomes 10. Now, 10 -7 =3. So the hundreds place is 1. So putting it all together, 138. Yes, that's correct. So the missing amount is 138 francs.

Wait, but let me confirm all steps again to be sure. Total cost 210. Charity pays 1/5, which is 42. Wei has 30. Total covered: 42 +30=72. 210-72=138. Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be 138 francs.
 
 The total cost of the conference is ₣210. The local charity covers a fifth of this cost:  
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 210 = 42 \text{ francs.}
\]  
Wei already has ₣30. Combining the charity's contribution and Wei's funds:  
\[
42 + 30 = 72 \text{ francs.}

The remaining amount needed is:  
\[
210 - 72 = 138 \text{ francs.}

36,"Ava went to the cafe and bought various types of treats. She bought 1 dozen danishes which cost $17 per dozen, 8 dozen tarts which cost $74 per dozen, and 3 dozen scones for $113 per dozen. How much was the total cost?",948,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Ava bought different types of treats, and I need to calculate the total cost. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, she bought 1 dozen danishes at $17 per dozen. So that's straightforward. One dozen would just be $17. No need to multiply by anything else here because it's already per dozen. So that part is easy.

Next, there's 8 dozen tarts, and each dozen costs $74. So for the tarts, I need to multiply 8 by $74. Let me do that calculation. 8 times 70 is 560, and 8 times 4 is 32. Adding those together, 560 + 32 equals $592. So the tarts cost $592 in total.

Then there are the scones. She bought 3 dozen, and each dozen is $113. So 3 multiplied by $113. Let's calculate that. 100 times 3 is 300, 10 times 3 is 30, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those: 300 + 30 is 330, plus 9 is 339. So the scones are $339.

Now, to find the total cost, I need to add up all these amounts. So $17 (danishes) + $592 (tarts) + $339 (scones). Let's add them step by step. 

First, 17 + 592. 17 + 500 is 517, then add 92 more. 517 + 92 is 609. Then add 339 to that. 609 + 339. Let's break it down: 600 + 300 is 900, 9 + 39 is 48. So 900 + 48 equals 948. 

Wait, let me check that again. 609 plus 339. Maybe another way: 609 + 300 is 909, then add 39 more. 909 + 39 is 948. Yeah, that's correct. So the total cost should be $948.

Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Danishes: 1 dozen at $17 → $17. Correct.

Tarts: 8 dozen at $74 each. 8*74. Let's compute 74*8. 70*8=560, 4*8=32. 560+32=592. That's right.

Scones: 3 dozen at $113. 113*3. 100*3=300, 10*3=30, 3*3=9. 300+30+9=339. Correct.

Adding all together: 17 + 592 = 609. Then 609 + 339. 609 + 300 = 909, plus 39 is 948. Yep, that adds up. So the total cost is $948.
 
 The total cost is calculated by summing the costs of each type of treat:

1. **Danishes**: 1 dozen × $17/dozen = **$17**  
2. **Tarts**: 8 dozen × $74/dozen = **$592**  
   - Calculation: \(8 \times 74 = 592\)  
3. **Scones**: 3 dozen × $113/dozen = **$339**  
   - Calculation: \(3 \times 113 = 339\)  

**Total Cost**: \(17 + 592 + 339 = 948\)  

**Answer**: The total cost was $\boxed{948}$.",True
37,"A lasagna has 30 pieces. If Nadia can eat 5 pieces a day while Leon can eat five times as much, how many days will the lasagna last?",1,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many days a lasagna with 30 pieces will last when Nadia and Leon are eating it. Nadia eats 5 pieces a day, and Leon eats five times as much as her. Hmm, so first, I need to find out how much Leon eats in a day.

Wait, the problem says Leon can eat five times as much as Nadia. Since Nadia eats 5 pieces a day, then Leon's consumption would be 5 multiplied by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 times 5 is 25. So Leon eats 25 pieces a day. 

Now, both Nadia and Leon are eating the lasagna. So together, how much do they eat each day? I need to add their daily consumption. Nadia's 5 plus Leon's 25. That's 5 + 25 = 30 pieces per day combined. 

The lasagna has 30 pieces total. If they're eating 30 pieces each day together, then the lasagna would last for one day. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. 

Total pieces: 30. Combined daily consumption: 30. So 30 divided by 30 equals 1. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be 1 day. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem states ""how many days will the lasagna last?"" So if they eat all 30 pieces in one day, then yes, it's one day. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Let me read the problem again. ""Nadia can eat 5 pieces a day while Leon can eat five times as much."" So Leon's five times as much as Nadia. So 5 times 5 is 25. Then total per day is 30. So 30 pieces divided by 30 per day is 1. 

I think that's correct. Maybe the problem is trying to test if you correctly calculate Leon's portion. If someone misreads it as Leon eating five pieces a day, then the answer would be different, but the problem says five times as much as Nadia. So 25. 

So yeah, the answer is 1 day.
 
 The lasagna has 30 pieces. Nadia eats 5 pieces per day, and Leon eats five times that amount. 

**Step 1:** Calculate Leon's daily consumption.  
Leon eats \(5 \text{ pieces/day} \times 5 = 25 \text{ pieces/day}\).

**Step 2:** Determine total daily consumption for both.  
Combined, they eat \(5 + 25 = 30 \text{ pieces/day}\).

**Step 3:** Divide total pieces by daily consumption.  
The lasagna lasts \(30 \div 30 = 1 \text{ day}\).

**Answer:** The lasagna will last 1 day.",True
38,A loaf of sourdough at the cafe costs €8. Muffins cost €4 each. How much more do 6 loaves of sourdough cost than 4 muffins?,32,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is asking how much more 6 loaves of sourdough cost compared to 4 muffins. Hmm, right. So first, I need to calculate the total cost for each item and then find the difference between them.

Alright, starting with the sourdough loaves. Each loaf costs €8. So if I need 6 of them, I should multiply 8 by 6. Let me do that. 8 times 6 is 48. So 6 loaves would cost €48 in total.

Now, the muffins. Each muffin is €4, and there are 4 of them. So that's 4 multiplied by 4. Let me check: 4 times 4 is 16. So 4 muffins cost €16 altogether.

The question is asking how much more the sourdough costs than the muffins. So I need to subtract the total cost of the muffins from the total cost of the sourdough. That would be 48 minus 16. Let me calculate that. 48 minus 16 equals 32. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Sourdough is more expensive per item, so buying more of them should result in a higher total. Yes, 6 loaves at €8 each is definitely more than 4 muffins at €4 each. The difference being 32 euros makes sense. I think that's right. Let me just double-check the calculations. 8*6=48, 4*4=16. 48-16=32. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be €32.
 
 To determine how much more 6 loaves of sourdough cost compared to 4 muffins:

1. **Calculate the total cost of sourdough loaves:**  
   \(6 \text{ loaves} \times €8/\text{loaf} = €48\).

2. **Calculate the total cost of muffins:**  
   \(4 \text{ muffins} \times €4/\text{muffin} = €16\).

3. **Find the difference:**  
   \(€48 - €16 = €32\).

39,"A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 210 floors. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 20 minutes per floor. If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?",70,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about a maintenance worker who needs to clean 210 floors in 10 days. Each floor takes 20 minutes, and they work 10 hours each day. We need to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors.

First, I need to figure out the total time required to clean all the floors. Since there are 210 floors and each takes 20 minutes, the total time would be 210 multiplied by 20 minutes. Let me calculate that. 210 times 20 is 4200 minutes. That's the total time needed.

But they have 10 days to do this. So we need to spread this total time over 10 days. So per day, the time spent cleaning would be 4200 minutes divided by 10 days. That gives 420 minutes per day. Wait, 4200 divided by 10 is 420. Right.

Now, the worker works 10 hours each day. But the time spent cleaning is in minutes, so I should convert the daily working hours into minutes to make the units match. 10 hours per day is 10 times 60 minutes, which is 600 minutes per day.

So each day, they spend 420 minutes cleaning. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, I need to divide the cleaning time by the total work time and multiply by 100. So (420 / 600) * 100.

Let me compute that. 420 divided by 600. Let's see, 420 divided by 600. Well, 420 divided by 600 is the same as 0.7, because 420 is 70% of 600. Because 600 times 0.7 is 420. So 0.7 times 100 is 70%. So the percentage is 70%.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each step again.

Total floors: 210. Time per floor: 20 minutes. Total time = 210 * 20 = 4200 minutes. Correct.

Total days: 10. So daily time is 4200 / 10 = 420 minutes per day. Yes.

Daily work time: 10 hours = 600 minutes. So 420 / 600 = 0.7. 0.7 * 100 = 70%. That seems right.

Hmm, but wait, is there any chance that the problem is considering the total time including non-working hours? Wait, the question says ""what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?"" Wait, their day—does that refer to their entire 24-hour day or their 10-hour workday?

Wait, the problem says ""they work 10 hours each day"". So when they ask for the percentage of their day, it's probably referring to the entire day (24 hours), but the problem might be ambiguous. Wait, let me check the wording again.

""If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?""

Hmm. The phrase ""their day"" could be interpreted as their working day (10 hours) or the entire day (24 hours). But in common usage, when someone works a certain number of hours a day and the question is about the percentage of their day spent on a task, it's usually referring to the working day. Because otherwise, if it's 24 hours, the percentage would be lower, but the problem might not be expecting that. Let me see.

Wait, the problem says ""they work 10 hours each day"". So during those 10 hours, they are working. The rest of the day is not work time. So the time spent cleaning is part of their 10-hour workday. Therefore, the percentage of their workday (10 hours) spent cleaning is 70%, as calculated. But the question says ""percentage of their day""—if ""their day"" refers to the entire 24-hour day, then the calculation would be different. Let me check the problem again.

The problem states: ""If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?""

So ""their day"" here could be ambiguous. But in most such problems, unless specified otherwise, ""their day"" refers to their working day. Because otherwise, the 10 hours worked each day would be part of the entire day. But let's see. Let's check both possibilities.

First interpretation: percentage of the 10-hour workday. Then, as before, 420 minutes (7 hours) out of 10 hours. 7/10 = 70%.

Second interpretation: percentage of the entire 24-hour day. Then 7 hours (420 minutes) divided by 24 hours. 7/24 ≈ 0.2917, which is about 29.17%. But the problem says ""they work 10 hours each day""—so the time spent cleaning is part of their work hours. So the 10 hours is their workday. The question is asking for the percentage of their day (the 24-hour period) spent cleaning. But that's a possible interpretation. However, in most standard math problems, when someone works a certain number of hours per day and the question is about the percentage of the day spent on the task, it's referring to the percentage of their working hours. But maybe not. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says ""what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?"" If ""their day"" is the entire day (24 hours), then the answer would be (7/24)*100 ≈ 29.17%. But if it's the working day (10 hours), then 70%. Which is correct?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let me see if there's any standard convention for such problems. Typically, in problems where a person works X hours a day and the question is about the percentage of the day spent working, the answer is X/24 *100. But in this case, the question is about the percentage of their day (while they are working) spent cleaning. Wait, but the problem states that they work 10 hours each day. So during those 10 hours, they are working. The time spent cleaning is part of their work hours. So the question is asking, of the total time they spend working each day (10 hours), what percentage is spent cleaning. Or is it asking, of the entire day (24 hours), what percentage is spent cleaning?

The wording is a bit unclear. Let me look at the exact phrasing again: ""what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?"" The key here is ""their day""—if ""their day"" is considered as the time they are working, then it's 10 hours. Otherwise, it's 24 hours. But in common language, when someone says ""what percentage of your day do you spend working"", they usually mean the entire day. But in this problem, the worker is working 10 hours a day, and the question is about the time spent cleaning during those work hours. So perhaps the intended answer is 70%, as calculated earlier. But to be thorough, let's check both possibilities.

If the answer is 70%, then the reasoning is as follows: total cleaning time per day is 420 minutes (7 hours). Since they work 10 hours per day, the percentage is (7/10)*100 = 70%.

If the answer is 29.17%, then it's (7/24)*100 ≈ 29.17%. But given that the worker is only working 10 hours a day, it's more likely that the question is asking what percentage of their working day (10 hours) is spent cleaning. Because otherwise, the 10 hours of work is part of the 24-hour day, and the time spent cleaning is part of that 10 hours. So the percentage of the entire day would be (7/24)*100, but the problem might not be expecting that. Let me see if there's any indication in the problem.

The problem states: ""If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?"" The phrase ""their day"" here is ambiguous. However, in standard math problems, when given a workday length (like 10 hours), and asked about the percentage of the day spent on a task, it's usually referring to the percentage of the workday. For example, if someone works 8 hours a day and spends 4 hours on a task, the percentage would be 50%, not 16.67% (4/24). So I think the intended answer here is 70%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 70%.
 
 To determine the percentage of the maintenance worker's day spent cleaning floors, follow these steps:

1. **Total Cleaning Time**:  
   - 210 floors × 20 minutes per floor = **4,200 minutes** total.

2. **Daily Cleaning Time**:  
   - 4,200 minutes ÷ 10 days = **420 minutes per day** (7 hours).

3. **Daily Work Hours in Minutes**:  
   - 10 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = **600 minutes/day**.

4. **Percentage of Workday Spent Cleaning**:  
   - \(\frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{600 \text{ minutes}} \times 100 = 70\%\).

**Answer**: 70% of their workday is spent cleaning floors.",True
40,"Daphne went to the coast for vacation. Her parents gave her ₣1400 to buy whatever she wanted. At the seaside store, cotton candy was on sale for ""Buy 15 pounds at ₣23 per pound, get 5 pounds 1/4 off."" She scooped up 22 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for ₣11.75 and 11 pins that were ₣21.0 each. How much money does Daphne have left?",680,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Daphne has 1400 francs to spend. She bought a bunch of stuff, and I need to figure out how much she has left. Let me break down each item she purchased step by step.

First, the cotton candy. The deal is ""Buy 15 pounds at 23 francs per pound, get 5 pounds 1/4 off."" Hmm, so maybe when you buy 15 pounds at the regular price, you can get an additional 5 pounds at a 25% discount? Or is it a promotion where if you buy 15 pounds, you get 5 pounds at 25% off? I need to parse that correctly.

Wait, the wording is ""Buy 15 pounds at ₣23 per pound, get 5 pounds 1/4 off."" So perhaps when you buy 15 pounds, you can purchase an extra 5 pounds with a 25% discount. So the total would be 15 + 5 = 20 pounds. But Daphne bought 22 pounds. So how does that work?

Let me think. If the promotion is for every 15 pounds bought at full price, you get 5 pounds at 25% off. So for every 15 pounds, you can add 5 pounds at discounted price. But she bought 22 pounds. Let's see how many times the promotion applies.

22 divided by (15+5) is 1.1, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the promotion is that when you buy 15 pounds, you get 5 pounds at 25% off. So if she buys 15 pounds, she can get 5 pounds at 25% off. But she bought 22 pounds. So maybe she can apply the promotion once, buying 15+5=20 pounds, and then the remaining 2 pounds at full price?

Wait, but 22 pounds. Let's see. Let's break it down. If the promotion is ""buy 15, get 5 at 25% off"", then for each 15 pounds purchased, you can get 5 pounds at the discounted rate. But perhaps the promotion is structured as a bulk deal. For example, if you buy 15 pounds at 23 each, then you can buy 5 pounds at 23 minus 25% of 23. So the total for 20 pounds would be (15 * 23) + (5 * 23 * 0.75). Then, if she buys 22 pounds, that's 20 pounds under the promotion plus 2 pounds at regular price.

Alternatively, maybe the promotion is that when you buy 15 pounds, you get 5 pounds at 25% off. So the total would be 15 + 5 = 20 pounds. But she bought 22, which is 20 + 2. So she would pay for 15 at full price, 5 at 25% off, and 2 at full price. That seems plausible.

So let's calculate the cost for the cotton candy first.

Regular price per pound is 23 francs. The discounted price for the 5 pounds would be 23 * (1 - 0.25) = 23 * 0.75 = 17.25 francs per pound.

So for the first 15 pounds: 15 * 23 = 345 francs.

Then the next 5 pounds (if she takes the promotion) would be 5 * 17.25 = 86.25 francs.

But wait, she bought 22 pounds. So 15 +5 =20, and then 2 more pounds. So the total would be 15*23 +5*17.25 +2*23.

Let me compute that:

15 *23 = 345

5 *17.25: 17.25 *5 = 86.25

2 *23 =46

Total for cotton candy: 345 +86.25 +46 = 477.25 francs.

Wait, but is the promotion applicable only once? Because 22 is more than 15+5=20. So if she buys 22, she can take the promotion once (15+5) and then 2 extra at full price. That makes sense. So that's how the cost is calculated.

Alternatively, maybe the promotion is that for every 15 pounds bought, you get 5 pounds at 25% off. But if she buys 22, perhaps she can't apply the promotion again because she doesn't have another 15 pounds. So yes, only one promotion applies.

So the cotton candy cost is 477.25 francs.

Next, she bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for 11.75 francs. That's straightforward: 11.75.

Then, 11 pins at 21.0 each. So 11 *21 = 231 francs.

Total expenditure is 477.25 +11.75 +231.

Let's add those up:

477.25 +11.75 = 489. Then 489 +231 = 720 francs.

So she spent 720 francs in total.

Her parents gave her 1400, so the remaining money is 1400 -720 = 680 francs.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, cotton candy:

15 *23 = 345. Correct.

5 *17.25: 17.25 *5. Let's compute 17 *5 =85, 0.25*5=1.25, so total 86.25. Correct.

2 *23 =46. Correct.

Total cotton candy: 345 +86.25 =431.25 +46 =477.25. Correct.

Coral pieces: 11.75. Correct.

Pins: 11 *21. 10*21=210, 1*21=21, total 231. Correct.

Total spent: 477.25 +11.75 = 489. Then 489 +231 =720. Correct.

Subtracting from 1400: 1400 -720 =680. So she has 680 francs left.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me check if there's another way the promotion could be interpreted. For example, maybe the ""buy 15 pounds, get 5 pounds at 1/4 off"" is a single deal where you pay for 15 pounds and get 5 pounds at 25% off. So the total for 20 pounds would be (15 *23) + (5 *23 *0.75) as before. But if she buys 22 pounds, perhaps she can't split it into 20 +2, but maybe the store allows multiple promotions? Let's see.

But 22 divided by 20 (the promotion bundle) is 1 with remainder 2. So she can do one promotion (20 pounds) and 2 extra. So the calculation is same as before. So the total is correct.

Alternatively, if the promotion is ""for every 15 pounds bought, you get 5 pounds at 25% off"", but she bought 22. Let's see how many times the 15 pounds apply. 22 divided by 15 is 1.466. So she can only apply the promotion once. Because she can't buy 15 pounds twice (that would be 30, which is more than 22). So yes, only one promotion applies. So the calculation remains the same.

Therefore, the answer should be 680 francs left.
 
 Daphne started with ₣1400. Let's calculate her total expenses:

**Cotton Candy:**
- **Promotion:** Buy 15 pounds at ₣23/pound, get 5 pounds at 25% off.
- **Total purchased:** 22 pounds.
  - 15 pounds at full price: \(15 \times 23 = ₣345\)
  - 5 pounds at 25% off: \(5 \times (23 \times 0.75) = 5 \times 17.25 = ₣86.25\)
  - Remaining 2 pounds at full price: \(2 \times 23 = ₣46\)

41,"A stack is made out of 8 white tiles, thrice as many orange tiles, and an unknown number of green tiles. If there are 38 tiles in the stack in total, how many green tiles are there?",6,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about a stack made of three different colored tiles: white, orange, and green. We need to find out how many green tiles there are. The total number of tiles is 38. Let me break down the information given.

First, there are 8 white tiles. Then it says there are thrice as many orange tiles as white tiles. Oh right, ""thrice"" means three times. So if there are 8 white tiles, then orange tiles would be 3 multiplied by 8. Let me calculate that. 3 times 8 is 24. So orange tiles are 24.

Now, the green tiles are unknown. Let's call the number of green tiles G. The total tiles are the sum of white, orange, and green. So total tiles = white + orange + green. The total is given as 38. So putting the numbers in: 8 (white) + 24 (orange) + G (green) = 38.

Let me add the white and orange tiles first. 8 plus 24 is 32. So 32 plus G equals 38. To find G, subtract 32 from 38. 38 minus 32 is 6. So G is 6. Therefore, there are 6 green tiles.

Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. White is 8, orange is 3 times that, so 24. 8+24=32. Total is 38, so 38-32=6. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be 6 green tiles.
 
 The stack consists of three types of tiles: white, orange, and green.  

- **White tiles**: 8  
- **Orange tiles**: Thrice the white tiles, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\)  
- **Total tiles**: 38  

Let \(G\) represent the number of green tiles. The total tiles equation is:  
\[
8 \ (\text{white}) + 24 \ (\text{orange}) + G \ (\text{green}) = 38
\]  
Adding white and orange tiles:  
\[
8 + 24 = 32
\]  
Subtracting this sum from the total tiles gives the number of green tiles:  
\[
G = 38 - 32 = 6
\]

42,Hiroshi goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs ₺20 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 45% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 1 kilogram of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for ₺3. How much did everything cost?,206,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Hiroshi usually buys tea that's 20 TL per kilogram. But his favorite was sold out, so he had to get a more expensive one that's 45% more. He buys a week's worth, which is 7 days, and uses 1 kg each day. Plus a bagel for 3 TL. Need to find the total cost.

First, figure out the price of the expensive tea. The original is 20 TL, 45% more. So 45% of 20 is... let's calculate that. 45% is 0.45, so 20 * 0.45 = 9. So the new price is 20 + 9 = 29 TL per kg. Wait, that seems right. So each kilogram is 29 TL now.

He needs a week's worth. Since he uses 1 kg per day, that's 7 days * 1 kg/day = 7 kg total. So 7 kg at 29 TL per kg. Let's compute that. 7 * 29. Let's see, 29*7: 20*7=140, 9*7=63, so 140+63=203 TL for the tea.

Then the bagel is 3 TL. So total cost is 203 + 3 = 206 TL. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check the calculations.

Original price: 20 TL. 45% increase: 20 * 1.45 = 29 TL. Correct. 7 kg: 7 * 29. Let's do 29*10=290, subtract 29*3=87, so 290-87=203. Yep. Then 203 +3=206. So the total should be 206 TL.
 
 Hiroshi's usual tea costs ₺20/kg. The expensive brand is 45% more, so:

**Price Increase:**  
₺20 × 45% = ₺20 × 0.45 = ₺9  
**New Price:**  
₺20 + ₺9 = **₺29/kg**

**Tea Cost for a Week:**  
7 days × 1 kg/day = 7 kg  
7 kg × ₺29/kg = **₺203**

Okay, let's see. The problem says that Bodhi found 3/5 as many caterpillars as grasshoppers in the garden. And there were 25 grasshoppers. We need to find the total number of insects. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how many caterpillars there are based on the number of grasshoppers.

Alright, so grasshoppers are 25. Caterpillars are 3/5 of that number. So to find the number of caterpillars, I multiply 25 by 3/5. Let me do that calculation. 25 times 3 is 75, and then divided by 5. 75 divided by 5 is 15. So there are 15 caterpillars.

Then, the total number of insects would be the sum of grasshoppers and caterpillars. So 25 grasshoppers plus 15 caterpillars. 25 plus 15 is 40. So the total should be 40 insects. Let me double-check. If there are 25 grasshoppers, and caterpillars are 3/5 of that, which is 15, adding them gives 40. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was converting the fraction correctly and then adding the two numbers together.
 
 To determine the total number of insects in the garden:

1. **Number of Grasshoppers**: Given as 25.
2. **Number of Caterpillars**: Calculated as \( \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \).
3. **Total Insects**: Sum of grasshoppers and caterpillars: \( 25 + 15 = 40 \).

**Answer**: The total number of insects in the garden is **40**.",True
44,"There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?",30,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem says there are 18 girls in the park. Then, the number of boys is two-thirds of that. Wait, wait. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. ""If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?"" Hmm. So, maybe the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls? Or is it the other way around? Let me parse the sentence again.

The problem states: ""There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?"" Wait, the phrasing here might be ambiguous. Let me think. The way it's written could be interpreted in two ways. Either:

1. The number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls. So boys = (2/3)*girls. Then total kids would be girls + boys.

Or,

2. The number of girls is two-thirds the number of boys. Wait, but the problem says ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"". Wait, the original problem says: ""There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park..."" Hmm. Let me parse the sentence structure.

The first part is ""There are 18 girls in the park."" Then, the second part is ""If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park..."" So, the structure is: Girls = 18. Boys = two-thirds of something. But of what? The way it's phrased, ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"", maybe it's that the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls. Because if it were the other way around, the sentence would probably be phrased like ""the number of girls is two-thirds the number of boys"". But here, the problem says ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"". Wait, maybe the problem is saying that the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls. Let me check.

If the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls, then boys = (2/3)*18 = 12. Then total kids would be 18 + 12 = 30.

Alternatively, if the problem is saying that the number of girls is two-thirds the number of boys, then girls = (2/3)*boys. Then boys = (18)/(2/3) = 27. Then total kids would be 18 + 27 = 45.

But the problem states: ""There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park..."" So the first part gives the number of girls, and the second part gives the number of boys as two-thirds. But two-thirds of what? The way it's written, ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"", which might mean that the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls. Because if it were the other way around, it would probably say ""the number of girls is two-thirds of the boys"". So I think the correct interpretation is that boys = (2/3)*girls. Let's confirm.

If girls are 18, then boys = 2/3 * 18 = 12. Total kids = 18 + 12 = 30. So the answer would be 30.

But wait, another way to parse the sentence: ""If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park"". Maybe ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"" as in the total number of boys is two-thirds. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The problem is structured as:

Given that there are 18 girls, and the number of boys is two-thirds (of something). The only logical ""something"" here is the number of girls. Because otherwise, if it's two-thirds of another number, the problem doesn't provide that number. So the only possible way is that boys are two-thirds of the girls. Therefore, boys = 2/3 * 18 = 12. Total kids = 30.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the number of girls is two-thirds the number of boys, but that would require the problem to say ""there are two-thirds as many girls as boys"" or something like that. Let me check the original wording again: ""There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?""

Hmm. The phrase ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"" could be ambiguous. Let's think of it as ""the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls"". Then boys = 2/3 * 18 = 12. Total kids 30.

Alternatively, if ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"" is referring to the total number of kids, but that seems less likely. For example, if the total number of kids is two-thirds boys, but that would be a different interpretation. But the problem states ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"", which probably compares boys to girls. So, the correct answer is 30. But I need to make sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that ""two-thirds the number of boys"" might mean that the number of boys is two-thirds of the total number of kids. But then, if that's the case, then boys = (2/3)*total kids. But girls would be 1/3 of total kids. But the problem says there are 18 girls. So 18 = (1/3)*total, so total would be 54. But then boys would be 54 - 18 = 36. But 36 is two-thirds of 54. So that's another possible interpretation. But does the problem's wording support that?

The problem says: ""There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?""

If the phrase ""two-thirds the number of boys"" is meant to say that boys make up two-thirds of the total kids, then girls would be one-third. But the problem states girls as 18, so total would be 54. But the wording is a bit unclear. The problem says ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"". If ""the number of boys"" is two-thirds of the total, then yes. But the phrasing is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls. So boys = 2/3 * 18 = 12, total 30.

So which interpretation is correct? The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous, but in standard math problems, when they say ""there are X number of A, and the number of B is two-thirds of that"", it usually refers to B being two-thirds of A. So in this case, since girls are mentioned first, and then boys are two-thirds, it's likely that boys are two-thirds of the number of girls.

Therefore, boys = (2/3)*18 = 12. Total kids = 18 + 12 = 30.

But to be thorough, let's check both interpretations.

First interpretation: boys = 2/3 of girls. Then total is 30.

Second interpretation: girls = 2/3 of boys. Then boys = 18 / (2/3) = 27. Total kids = 18 + 27 = 45.

Third interpretation: boys are two-thirds of the total kids. Then girls are one-third. So total kids = 18 * 3 = 54. Boys = 54 - 18 = 36. But 36 is two-thirds of 54. So that's another possible answer.

So the problem is ambiguous. However, in standard math problems, when they say ""the number of B is two-thirds the number of A"", it's B = (2/3)*A. So if the problem had said ""the number of boys is two-thirds the number of girls"", then boys = 12. But the problem's wording is ""there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park"". The phrasing is a bit unclear. Let's parse the sentence structure.

Original problem: ""There are 18 girls in the park. If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?""

The second part starts with ""If there are two-thirds the number of boys in the park"". The ""there are"" might be indicating that the number of boys is two-thirds of something. But of what? The previous sentence mentions 18 girls. So the most logical interpretation is that the number of boys is two-thirds of the number of girls. So boys = 2/3 * 18 = 12. Total kids = 30.

Alternatively, if the problem had said ""the number of girls is two-thirds the number of boys"", then girls = 2/3 * boys, so boys = 27. But the problem says ""there are two-thirds the number of boys"", which could be read as ""the number of boys is two-thirds of [something]"". The something here would logically be the number of girls, since that's the only other number given.

Therefore, the answer is 30.
 
 The problem states there are 18 girls in the park and the number of boys is two-thirds of this amount. To find the total number of kids:

1. **Calculate the number of boys**:  
   Boys = (2/3) × Girls = (2/3) × 18 = **12**.

2. **Add the number of girls and boys**:  
   Total kids = Girls + Boys = 18 + 12 = **30**.

45,"Valentina has a flower bed that is 217 meters long. Valentina wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Valentina's flowers grow 3 meters wide so she needs to leave 15.5 meters between every plant. Valentina already owns 11 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €14 at the store, how much money will Valentina spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",42,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Valentina has a flower bed that's 217 meters long. She wants to plant flowers that are each 3 meters wide, and she needs to leave 15.5 meters between each plant. She already has 11 flowers. Each new plant costs €14, and we need to find out how much she'll spend to fill the bed.

First, I need to figure out how many plants she can fit in the 217 meters. But wait, each plant takes up 3 meters in width, and then there's 15.5 meters between them. Hmm, maybe I should model this as the space each plant plus the space between them takes.

Wait, the arrangement might be like: plant, then space, then plant, etc. So for each additional plant after the first one, there's a space before it. So the total length would be (number of plants * 3) + (number of spaces * 15.5). But how many spaces are there?

If there are N plants, then the number of spaces between them is N - 1. Because between two plants there's one space. So the total length required is 3*N + 15.5*(N-1). This should be less than or equal to 217 meters.

So the equation would be 3N + 15.5(N - 1) ≤ 217.

Let me compute that. Combine like terms:

3N + 15.5N - 15.5 ≤ 217

18.5N - 15.5 ≤ 217

Add 15.5 to both sides:

18.5N ≤ 217 + 15.5 = 232.5

Then N ≤ 232.5 / 18.5

Let me calculate that. 232.5 divided by 18.5. Let's see:

18.5 * 12 = 222 (since 18*12=216, 0.5*12=6, total 222)

232.5 - 222 = 10.5 left. So 10.5 / 18.5 = 0.567... So total N is 12.567. Since she can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 12 plants? Wait, but wait, maybe I should check if 12 plants fit.

Wait, let's compute 3*12 + 15.5*(12-1) = 36 + 15.5*11.

15.5 * 11: 15*11=165, 0.5*11=5.5, total 170.5. So total length is 36 + 170.5 = 206.5 meters. That's under 217. What about 13 plants?

3*13 = 39, 15.5*(12) = 186. Total 39 + 186 = 225. That's over 217. So 13 plants would require 225 meters, which is more than 217. So maximum number of plants is 12.

Wait, but wait, maybe there's a different way to arrange them. Like, maybe the space after the last plant isn't needed. Wait, the problem says she needs to leave 15.5 meters between every plant. So between each pair of plants, there's 15.5 meters. So if there are N plants, there are N-1 spaces between them. So the total length is indeed 3*N + 15.5*(N-1). So that's correct.

So with 12 plants, total length is 206.5 meters. That leaves 217 - 206.5 = 10.5 meters unused. But since 13 plants would require 225 meters, which is over, she can't fit more. So the maximum number of plants is 12.

Wait, but wait, maybe the calculation is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, 18.5N = 232.5 → N = 232.5 / 18.5. Let me compute that exactly. 232.5 divided by 18.5.

18.5 × 12 = 222. Then 232.5 - 222 = 10.5. 10.5 / 18.5 = 0.567. So N ≈12.567. So the maximum integer N is 12. So 12 plants.

But wait, maybe she can fit 12 plants, but the total length is 206.5, which is under 217. But maybe she can adjust the spacing? The problem says she needs to leave 15.5 meters between every plant. So she can't reduce the spacing. So she can't fit more than 12 plants. Therefore, she needs 12 plants.

But wait, Valentina already owns 11 flowers. So she needs 12 - 11 = 1 more plant? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of plants needed is 12, and she already has 11. So she needs to buy 1 plant. But wait, that seems low. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's redo the calculation step by step.

Total length required for N plants: 3*N + 15.5*(N-1) ≤ 217.

So 3N +15.5N -15.5 ≤217 → 18.5N -15.5 ≤217 → 18.5N ≤ 232.5 → N ≤232.5 /18.5.

Calculating 232.5 ÷18.5:

18.5 ×12 = 222. 232.5 -222 =10.5. 10.5 ÷18.5 = 0.567. So N=12.567. So maximum integer N is 12.

So total plants needed:12. She has 11, so she needs to buy 1. Then the cost is 1 ×14€=14€.

But that seems very low. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spacing is after each plant except the last one. So the total length is (3 +15.5) multiplied by (N-1) plus 3. Because each plant after the first one adds 3m (plant) plus 15.5m (space). So for N plants, the total length is 3 + (3 +15.5)*(N-1). Let's see:

For example, if N=1: 3 meters.

N=2: 3 + (3+15.5) =3 +18.5=21.5.

N=3: 3 +18.5*2=3+37=40.

Wait, but earlier calculation was 3N +15.5*(N-1). Let's check for N=2:

3*2 +15.5*(1)=6 +15.5=21.5. Same as the other method. So both methods are equivalent. So the formula is correct.

So for N=12: 3*12 +15.5*11=36 +170.5=206.5. Which is under 217. So she can fit 12 plants. But she already has 11. So she needs 1 more. So cost is 14€.

But that seems too easy. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says ""fill her flower bed with plants"". So maybe the calculation is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the spacing is between the plants. So each plant is 3 meters wide, and between them, there's 15.5 meters. So the total space for N plants would be:

Each plant takes 3m, and between each pair, 15.5m. So for N plants, there are (N-1) spaces. So total length is 3*N +15.5*(N-1). Which is the same as before.

So for N=12: 3*12=36, 15.5*11=170.5. Total 206.5. So 217-206.5=10.5 meters left. But she can't fit another plant because 3+15.5=18.5 would require 18.5 meters more, which she doesn't have. So 12 is the max.

But she already has 11 flowers. So she needs 12-11=1 more. So cost is 1*14=14€.

But maybe I'm missing that the spacing is required even if there's space left. Wait, no. The problem states she needs to leave 15.5 meters between every plant. So between each adjacent pair, there must be 15.5m. So even if there's extra space at the end, that's okay. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 14 euros. But this seems very low. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the number of plants she can fit. Let me try N=12 again.

Total length: 3*12=36, spaces:11*15.5=170.5. Total 36+170.5=206.5. So 217-206.5=10.5 meters left. But she can't add another plant because the next plant would need 3m plus another 15.5m space (since there's a plant after it). But since there's no plant after, maybe the last space isn't needed. Wait, but the problem says between every plant. So if she adds a 13th plant, the spacing between the 12th and 13th would need to be 15.5m. So total length would be 3*13 +15.5*12=39 + 186=225, which is over 217. So 13 is too much.

So 12 is the maximum. So she needs 12 plants. She has 11, so buys 1. Cost 14€.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the spacing is after each plant, including the last one. But that doesn't make sense. The problem says between every plant, so between two plants. So the last plant doesn't need a space after it. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is 14 euros.
 
 Valentina's flower bed is 217 meters long. Each plant requires 3 meters of width, and 15.5 meters of spacing between adjacent plants. To determine how many plants fit:

1. **Total length per plant and spacing**: For \( N \) plants, the total length is \( 3N + 15.5(N - 1) \).
2. **Solve for \( N \)**:
   \[
   3N + 15.5(N - 1) \leq 217 \\
   18.5N - 15.5 \leq 217 \\
   18.5N \leq 232.5 \\
   N \leq \frac{232.5}{18.5} \approx 12.57
   \]
   Since \( N \) must be an integer, the maximum is **12 plants**.

3. **Check total length for 12 plants**:
   \[
   3(12) + 15.5(11) = 36 + 170.5 = 206.5 \text{ meters (fits within 217 meters)}.

After accounting for 1200 seats for graduates and 100 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",5,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many tickets each graduate gets for their friends and family when the total capacity of the auditorium is 7300. They have to subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty first, then split the remaining equally among the graduates.

First, I need to find out how many seats are left after allocating for graduates and faculty. The graduates take up 1200 seats, and the faculty 100. So total reserved seats are 1200 + 100. Let me add those: 1200 plus 100 is 1300. So the remaining seats for friends and family would be the total capacity minus that. So 7300 minus 1300. Let me calculate that. 7300 - 1300 is 6000. So there are 6000 tickets available for distribution.

Now, these 6000 tickets need to be split equally among the graduates. But wait, how many graduates are there? The problem mentions 1200 seats for graduates. So does that mean there are 1200 graduates? Because each graduate would need a seat. So if there are 1200 graduates, then each would get an equal share of the 6000 tickets.

So the number of tickets per graduate is 6000 divided by 1200. Let me do that division. 6000 divided by 1200. Hmm, 1200 times 5 is 6000. So 6000 ÷ 1200 = 5. So each graduate would get 5 tickets.

Wait, let me double-check. Total seats: 7300. Graduates take 1200, faculty 100. 7300 - 1200 - 100 = 6000. Then 6000 divided by number of graduates, which is 1200. Yes, 6000/1200 is indeed 5. That seems right. So each graduate receives 5 tickets.
 
 To determine how many tickets each graduate receives for friends and family:

1. **Calculate reserved seats**:  
   Graduates: 1200 seats  
   Faculty: 100 seats  
   Total reserved = 1200 + 100 = **1300 seats**

2. **Find remaining tickets for guests**:  
   Total auditorium capacity = 7300  
   Guest tickets = 7300 - 1300 = **6000 tickets**

3. **Divide guest tickets equally among graduates**:  
   Number of graduates = 1200  
   Tickets per graduate = 6000 ÷ 1200 = **5**

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Umar hiding 6 dozen eggs for an Easter egg hunt, and then different kids finding some of them. We need to figure out how many eggs are still hidden after all the kids have found their share.

First, I need to convert the total eggs into a number. Since a dozen is 12, 6 dozen would be 6 times 12. Let me calculate that. 6 times 12 is 72. So Umar hid 72 eggs in total.

Now, let's go through each kid one by one. Quinn finds 12 eggs. That's straightforward. Then Isabella finds two times as many as Quinn. So if Quinn found 12, Isabella found 2 * 12. Let me compute that. 2 times 12 is 24. So Isabella has 24 eggs.

Next, Mia finds 4 less than Isabella. Isabella has 24, so Mia's eggs are 24 minus 4. That would be 20. Wait, 24 minus 4 is 20. So Mia found 20 eggs.

Then Nia finds a quarter as many as Mia. Mia has 20, so a quarter of that is 20 divided by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5. So Nia found 5 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by the kids. Quinn:12, Isabella:24, Mia:20, Nia:5. Adding those together. Let's do 12 +24 first. That's 36. Then 36 +20 is 56. Then 56 +5 is 61. So total found eggs are 61.

But the total hidden was 72. So subtract the found eggs from the total. 72 minus 61. Let's see, 72 minus 60 is 12, then minus 1 more is 11. So 11 eggs are still hidden.

Wait, let me check my math again to be sure. Total eggs: 6*12=72. Correct. Quinn:12. Isabella: 12*2=24. Mia:24-4=20. Nia:20/4=5. Total found:12+24=36, 36+20=56, 56+5=61. 72-61=11. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be 11 eggs remaining.
 
 Umar hid 6 dozen eggs, which is \(6 \times 12 = 72\) eggs.  

**Eggs found by each child:**  
- **Quinn:** 12 eggs  
- **Isabella:** \(2 \times 12 = 24\) eggs  
- **Mia:** \(24 - 4 = 20\) eggs  
- **Nia:** \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\) eggs  

**Total eggs found:**  
\(12 + 24 + 20 + 5 = 61\) eggs  

**Eggs remaining hidden:**  
\(72 - 61 = 11\)

48,Kayla can peel 6 mushrooms a minute and saute 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 mushrooms?,71,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Kayla can peel 6 mushrooms a minute. And she can sauté 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes. The question is, how long will it take her to peel and sauté 120 mushrooms? Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out the time it takes for peeling and the time for sautéing, and then see how they overlap or if they are done sequentially. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether she can do both tasks at the same time. Like, maybe she peels first and then sautés, or maybe she can peel while sautéing? That's an important point. Because if she can do both at the same time, the total time might be the maximum of the two times. But if she has to do them one after the other, then it's the sum. The problem statement isn't clear on that. Hmm. Let me read the problem again.

""Kayla can peel 6 mushrooms a minute and sauté 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and sauté 120 mushrooms?""

So, the problem says ""peel and sauté"", which might imply that both actions need to be done. But the way it's phrased, maybe she can do them in parallel. For example, maybe she can peel mushrooms while some are sautéing. But that depends on whether the tasks can be overlapped. Let's think.

If she has to peel all the mushrooms first and then sauté them, then the total time would be peeling time plus sautéing time. But if she can peel some mushrooms and start sautéing them while continuing to peel the rest, then the total time might be less. But this requires knowing whether the sautéing is a batch process. For example, if she can sauté in batches. Let's see. The problem says she can sauté 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes. So that's a rate. So maybe her sautéing capacity is 40 mushrooms every 17 minutes. So perhaps she can sauté in batches of 40, each taking 17 minutes. Alternatively, maybe her sautéing rate is 40/17 mushrooms per minute. Wait, that's possible. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says she can sauté 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes. So her sautéing rate is 40 mushrooms per 17 minutes. So per minute, that's 40/17 ≈ 2.3529 mushrooms per minute. But that seems a bit slow. Alternatively, maybe she can sauté 40 mushrooms in 17 minutes, which would be a rate of 40/17 per minute, but maybe she can only sauté a certain number at a time. Hmm. But the problem doesn't mention any limitations on how many she can sauté at once. So perhaps the 17 minutes is the time required to sauté 40 mushrooms, regardless of how many are in the pan. So if she needs to sauté 120 mushrooms, she would need to do three batches of 40, each taking 17 minutes. That would be 3*17=51 minutes. But that's assuming she can't overlap peeling and sautéing. Alternatively, maybe she can peel while some mushrooms are sautéing. Let's think about this.

Alternatively, maybe the sautéing is a continuous process. For example, if she can sauté mushrooms at a rate of 40 mushrooms every 17 minutes, then the rate is 40/17 mushrooms per minute. Similarly, her peeling rate is 6 mushrooms per minute. So for 120 mushrooms, the peeling time would be 120/6 = 20 minutes. The sautéing time would be 120/(40/17) = 120*(17/40) = 51 minutes. If she does them sequentially, total time is 20 + 51 = 71 minutes. But if she can do them in parallel, the total time would be the maximum of the two, which is 51 minutes. But that's only possible if she can peel and sauté at the same time, which might not be feasible. For example, maybe she can peel a mushroom and then put it into the pan, but once the pan is on, she can't add more mushrooms until the sautéing is done. So maybe the sautéing has to be done in batches, and during the time each batch is sautéing, she can peel more mushrooms. Let's model this.

Suppose she starts by peeling mushrooms. Let's say she peels as many as she can and starts sautéing them. Let's see. Let's assume she can peel mushrooms and then sauté them in batches. For example, she peels some mushrooms, starts sautéing them, and while they are cooking, she continues peeling more. Let's try to model this.

But first, let's get the rates straight. Peeling rate: 6 mushrooms per minute. Sautéing rate: 40 mushrooms take 17 minutes. So per batch of 40 mushrooms, it takes 17 minutes. So if she has to sauté 120 mushrooms, that's three batches of 40, each taking 17 minutes. But if she can prepare the next batch while the previous one is cooking, then the total time might be less.

Alternatively, maybe the sautéing is a continuous process where she can add mushrooms as she peels them, but that's probably not the case. Usually, sautéing requires a certain amount of time per batch. So let's assume she can only sauté 40 mushrooms at a time, each batch taking 17 minutes. So she needs to do three batches for 120 mushrooms. Now, the question is, can she peel the mushrooms for the next batch while the current batch is sautéing?

Let's think step by step.

First, she needs to peel enough mushrooms for the first batch. The first batch is 40 mushrooms. At 6 mushrooms per minute, peeling 40 mushrooms would take 40/6 ≈ 6.6667 minutes, which is 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Then, she starts sautéing the first batch, which takes 17 minutes. During those 17 minutes, she can continue peeling the next batches. Let's see how many mushrooms she can peel during the 17 minutes of sautéing the first batch. 17 minutes * 6 mushrooms per minute = 102 mushrooms. Wait, but she needs 80 more mushrooms for the next two batches (since 120 total, first batch 40, remaining 80). So in 17 minutes, she can peel 102 mushrooms, which is more than enough for the remaining 80. So perhaps after the first batch is sautéing, she can peel the remaining 80 mushrooms in 80/6 ≈ 13.3333 minutes. But she has 17 minutes while the first batch is cooking. So she can peel all the remaining mushrooms during that time. Then, after the first batch is done, she can immediately start the second batch. But wait, the second batch would take another 17 minutes, but during that time, she might have already peeled all the mushrooms. Wait, but she only needs 80 more mushrooms. Let me check.

Total mushrooms needed: 120.

First batch: 40 mushrooms. Time to peel: 40/6 ≈6.6667 minutes. Then she starts sautéing that batch, which takes 17 minutes. During those 17 minutes,

49,Umar collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first 2 have 450 apartments each and the last one is 20% bigger than the other 2 combined. Umar collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.45 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,1782,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how much money Umar makes in a week. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. 

First, there are three apartment complexes. The first two each have 450 apartments. So, the first two combined would be 450 plus 450. Let me write that down: 450 + 450 = 900 apartments. Right, so the first two together have 900 apartments.

Now, the third apartment complex is 20% bigger than the other two combined. Wait, the other two combined are 900, so 20% of 900 is... let's calculate that. 20% is the same as 0.20, so 900 multiplied by 0.20. 900 * 0.2 = 180. So, the third complex is 900 + 180 = 1080 apartments. Got that. So the third one has 1080 apartments.

Now, let's total up all the apartments. The first two are 450 each, so 450 + 450 = 900, plus the third's 1080. So 900 + 1080 = 1980 apartments in total. Wait, but maybe I don't need the total apartments yet. Let me check the problem again.

Umar collects garbage 2 times a week from each place. Wait, each place refers to each apartment complex, right? So each of the three complexes gets collected twice a week. So for each complex, he does 2 collections per week. And for each collection per apartment, he gets paid ₣0.45. So the payment is per apartment per collection.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total number of apartments across all complexes first. Then multiply by the number of collections per week, then by the rate per collection.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in each complex.
   - Complex 1: 450
   - Complex 2: 450
   - Complex 3: 20% larger than the first two combined. The first two combined are 900, so 900 * 1.2 = 1080.

2. Total apartments: 450 + 450 + 1080 = 1980 apartments.

But wait, the problem says he collects garbage 2 times a week from each place. So each complex is collected twice a week. For each collection, each apartment in that complex contributes ₣0.45. So for each complex, the weekly earnings would be (number of apartments) * 2 collections * ₣0.45 per collection.

Alternatively, total collections per week for all complexes would be 3 complexes * 2 collections per week = 6 total collections? Wait, no. Wait, each complex is collected twice a week. So each complex contributes 2 collections. So for each complex, the number of collections per week is 2. Then, per complex, the payment is apartments * 2 * 0.45.

So maybe the total money is (sum of apartments across all complexes) * 2 (collections per week per complex) * 0.45. Wait, no. Wait, each complex is collected twice a week. So for each complex, the calculation is apartments * 2 * 0.45. Then sum all three complexes.

Wait, but maybe each apartment is charged per collection. So for each apartment, if the complex is collected twice a week, then each apartment is charged twice. So per apartment, per week, it's 2 * 0.45 = ₣0.90. Then total is total apartments * 0.90.

Wait, but let's check that. Let's take complex 1: 450 apartments. Collected twice a week. So each collection is 450 apartments. So per week, 450 * 2 collections = 900 collections. Each collection per apartment gives him ₣0.45. So 900 * 0.45 = 405 francs per week from complex 1. Similarly for complex 2: 450 * 2 * 0.45 = 405. Complex 3: 1080 * 2 * 0.45. Let's calculate that: 1080 * 2 = 2160; 2160 * 0.45. Let's compute that. 2000 * 0.45 = 900, 160 * 0.45 = 72, so total 972. So total from all complexes is 405 + 405 + 972 = 405*2=810 +972= 1782. So total weekly earnings would be ₣1782.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as total apartments (1980) multiplied by 2 collections per week, then by 0.45. So 1980 * 2 = 3960. 3960 * 0.45. Let's see: 4000 * 0.45 = 1800, minus 40 * 0.45 = 18, so 1800 - 18 = 1782. Same result. So that's correct.

So the answer should be ₣1782.
 
 Umar collects garbage from three apartment complexes. Here's the breakdown:

1. **First two complexes**: Each has 450 apartments.  
   Combined: \(450 + 450 = 900\) apartments.

2. **Third complex**: 20% larger than the first two combined.  
   \(20\% \text{ of } 900 = 0.2 \times 900 = 180\), so \(900 + 180 = 1080\) apartments.

**Total apartments**: \(900 + 1080 = 1980\).

**Weekly collections**: Each complex is serviced twice a week.  
Total collections per week: \(1980 \text{ apartments} \times 2 = 3960\) collections.

**Payment**: ₣0.45 per collection.  
Total earnings: \(3960 \times 0.45 = ₣1782\).

50,"The area of Diego's rectangular kitchen is 390 square meters. If the length of his room is 5 meters, what is the perimeter of the room in meters?",166,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the perimeter of Diego's rectangular kitchen. The area is given as 390 square meters, and the length is 5 meters. Hmm, right. So, I need to find the perimeter.

First, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and the width. The formula is Area = length × width. So, if I have the area and one of the sides, I can find the other side. Here, the length is 5 meters, so the width must be the area divided by the length. Let me write that down.

Width = Area / Length. Plugging in the numbers: Width = 390 / 5. Let me calculate that. 390 divided by 5. 5 times 78 is 390, right? Because 5 times 70 is 350, and 5 times 8 is 40. 350 + 40 is 390. So the width is 78 meters.

Wait, that seems really big. A kitchen that's 5 meters long and 78 meters wide? That's like a very long and narrow kitchen. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. 5 meters times 78 meters equals 390 square meters. Yeah, 5*70=350, 5*8=40, so 350+40=390. So the math checks out. Maybe the numbers are just like that. Okay, moving on.

Now, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. The formula is Perimeter = 2*(length + width). So once I have both the length and width, I can plug them in. The length is 5 meters, and the width we found is 78 meters. So substituting those values in:

Perimeter = 2*(5 + 78) = 2*(83) = 166 meters.

Wait, that's a huge perimeter for a kitchen. But according to the given numbers, that's what it comes out to. Let me double-check the calculations. Area is 390, length 5, so width is 78. Then perimeter is 2*(5+78) = 2*83 = 166. Yeah, that's correct. Maybe the problem has a typo, but given the numbers as they are, the answer should be 166 meters. I guess even though the dimensions seem unrealistic, mathematically it's correct. So the perimeter is 166 meters.
 
 The area of a rectangle is calculated as length × width. Given the area (390 m2) and length (5 m), we first find the width:

\[
\text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{390}{5} = 78 \text{ meters}.
\]

Next, calculate the perimeter using the formula \(2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\):

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (5 + 78) = 2 \times 83 = 166 \text{ meters}.

He usually sells tulips for €2.25 per bundle, roses for €5.13 per bundle and sunflowers for €5.47 per bundle. Viktor has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Viktor sells 12 bundles of tulips, 29 bundles of roses and 37 bundles of sunflowers, how much will he make?",354,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Viktor sells three types of plants: tulips, roses, and sunflowers. The original prices are €2.25, €5.13, and €5.47 per bundle respectively. But he's rounding them to the nearest dollar because he has no change today. Then he sells certain quantities of each. The question is, how much will he make in total after rounding the prices?

First, I need to figure out the rounded prices for each. Let's start with each plant's price.

Tulips are €2.25 per bundle. Rounding to the nearest dollar. Hmm, 2.25 is exactly halfway between 2 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, 2.25 is 2 euros and 25 cents. The nearest dollar would be determined by the cents. If the cents are 50 or above, you round up, otherwise down. So 2.25 is 2.25, which is 25 cents. Since 25 is less than 50, so it rounds down to €2.00.

Roses are €5.13. The cents here are 13, which is less than 50, so that rounds down to €5.00.

Sunflowers are €5.47. The cents here are 47, which is still less than 50? Wait, no. Wait, 47 is less than 50, so it would round down to €5.00. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5.47 is 5 euros and 47 cents. Since 47 is less than 50, you round down. So that's €5.00. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Wait, 5.47 is closer to 5 than to 6? Let's check. The halfway point between 5 and 6 is 5.50. So anything below 5.50 rounds down to 5, and 5.50 or above rounds up to 6. So 5.47 is 0.03 below 5.50, so it's closer to 5. So yes, rounded to €5.00.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should confirm each one again.

Tulips: 2.25. The .25 is 25 cents. Since that's less than 50, round down to 2.

Roses: 5.13. 13 cents, so round down to 5.

Sunflowers: 5.47. 47 cents, which is less than 50, so round down to 5.

So all three are rounded down. So the new prices are €2, €5, and €5 respectively.

Now, he sells 12 bundles of tulips. So 12 * 2 = 24 euros.

29 bundles of roses: 29 * 5 = 145 euros.

37 bundles of sunflowers: 37 * 5 = 185 euros.

Adding those up: 24 + 145 + 185.

Let's compute step by step. 24 + 145 is 169. Then 169 + 185. 169 + 185: 169 + 100 is 269, then +85 is 354. So total is 354 euros.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again to be sure.

12 tulips at €2 each: 12*2=24. Correct.

29 roses at €5 each: 29*5. Let's compute 29*5. 20*5=100, 9*5=45. 100+45=145. Correct.

37 sunflowers at €5 each: 37*5. 30*5=150, 7*5=35. 150+35=185. Correct.

Total: 24 + 145 = 169. Then 169 + 185. Let's add 169 + 185. 169 + 185. Break it down: 169 + 180 = 349, then +5 = 354. So total is 354 euros.

Therefore, Viktor will make €354 in total after rounding the prices.
 
 Viktor rounds each plant's price to the nearest dollar:

- **Tulips**: €2.25 rounds down to **€2** (since 25¢ < 50¢).
- **Roses**: €5.13 rounds down to **€5** (13¢ < 50¢).
- **Sunflowers**: €5.47 rounds down to **€5** (47¢ < 50¢).

Calculating total revenue for each plant:
- **Tulips**: \(12 \text{ bundles} \times €2 = €24\)
- **Roses**: \(29 \text{ bundles} \times €5 = €145\)
- **Sunflowers**: \(37 \text{ bundles} \times €5 = €185\)

Okay, let's see. Qasim has 5 ₣50 bills. First, I need to figure out how much money he has in total. Each bill is 50 francs, so 5 times 50. Let me calculate that. 5 times 50 is 250. So he starts with 250 francs.

Now, he buys 6 coloring books. Each one costs 8 francs. So the total cost for the coloring books would be 6 multiplied by 8. Let me do that. 6 times 8 is 48. So that's 48 francs for the coloring books.

Then he buys 5 packs of trading cards. Each pack is 4 francs. So that's 5 times 4. 5 times 4 is 20. So the trading cards cost 20 francs.

Now, I need to add up the total amount he spent. The coloring books were 48 and the cards 20. Adding those together: 48 plus 20 equals 68. So total expenditure is 68 francs.

To find out how much he has left, subtract the total spent from his initial amount. He had 250, spent 68. So 250 minus 68. Let me compute that. 250 minus 60 is 190, then minus 8 more is 182. So 250 - 68 = 182.

Wait, let me double-check the subtraction to be sure. 250 - 68. Another way: 68 is 70 minus 2. So 250 - 70 is 180, then add back 2, which gives 182. Yep, same result. So he should have 182 francs left.
 
 Qasim starts with 5 × ₣50 = ₣250. 

**Expenses:**
- **Coloring Books:** 6 × ₣8 = ₣48  
- **Trading Cards:** 5 × ₣4 = ₣20

Okay, let's see. The problem says Oliver scored 354 points in a dart game. Camila scored 42 points more than two-fourths as many as Oliver. We need to find the total points they both have together.

First, I need to figure out Camila's score. Let me break down the information. The phrase ""two-fourths as many as Oliver"" sounds like taking two-fourths of Oliver's score. Then adding 42 points to that. So Camila's points would be (2/4)*Oliver's points + 42.

Wait, two-fourths is the same as a half, right? Because 2 divided by 4 is 0.5. So maybe simplifying that first. So instead of calculating two-fourths, I can just use half. That might make the calculation easier.

So Oliver has 354 points. Two-fourths of that is (2/4)*354. Let me compute that. But since 2/4 is 1/2, it's 354 divided by 2. 354 divided by 2 is 177. Then add 42 to that. So 177 + 42 = 219. So Camila scored 219 points.

Wait, let me check that again. The problem says Camila scored 42 points more than two-fourths of Oliver's score. So yes, two-fourths of 354 is 177, plus 42 gives 219. That seems right.

Now, the total points would be Oliver's points plus Camila's points. So 354 + 219. Let me add those. 354 + 200 is 554, then plus 19 is 573. So the total is 573 points.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recalculate Camila's score step by step. Two-fourths of 354: 354 multiplied by 2 is 708, divided by 4. 708 divided by 4. Let's see, 4 times 177 is 708. So yes, that's 177. Then adding 42 gives 219. Correct. Then adding to Oliver's 354: 354 + 219. 350 + 210 is 560, plus 4 +9 is 13. So 560 +13 = 573. Yep, that's right.

So the total points they have together is 573. I think that's the answer.
 
 Camila's score is calculated by taking two-fourths (which simplifies to half) of Oliver's points and adding 42. 

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. **Camila's Points:**
   - Two-fourths of Oliver's 354 points:  
     \( \frac{2}{4} \times 354 = \frac{1}{2} \times 354 = 177 \)
   - Add 42 points:

Okay, let's see. Yara sliced a kiwi into 31 pieces. But the question is about how many slices they all ate. Wait, the total slices are 31, but maybe that's just a detail here. The problem is asking for the total number of slices eaten by Yara, her sister, and her cousin.

So, let's break it down step by step. First, Yara ate 4 slices. Then her sister ate 6 more than her. Wait, 6 more than Yara? So Yara had 4, sister ate 4 + 6 = 10 slices? Let me check that again. The problem says her sister ate 6 more than her. So yes, if Yara ate 4, sister ate 4 + 6 = 10. Then the cousin ate 3 more than her sister. So the sister ate 10, so cousin ate 10 + 3 = 13 slices.

Now, to find the total they all ate, we add them up: Yara (4) + sister (10) + cousin (13) = 4 + 10 is 14, plus 13 is 27. So altogether they ate 27 slices. Wait, but the kiwi was sliced into 31 pieces. Does that matter here? The problem is only asking how many they ate, not how many are left. So the answer should be 27. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any numbers.

Yara:4. Sister:4+6=10. Cousin:10+3=13. Total:4+10+13=27. Yeah, that seems right. The 31 slices might be a distractor, but the question is only about the eaten slices. So the answer is 27.
 
 Yara ate **4 slices**. Her sister ate **6 more than Yara**, which is \(4 + 6 = 10\) slices. Her cousin ate **3 more than her sister**, totaling \(10 + 3 = 13\) slices. 

Adding all the slices they ate:

55,"Gabrielle is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full two times, writes two-fourths of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Gabrielle written in total?",130,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many letters Gabrielle has written in total. Hmm, the problem says she's rewriting the alphabet until she knows it. Let me break down the steps she takes according to the problem.

First, she writes the entire alphabet two times. The alphabet has 26 letters, right? So each time she writes it fully, that's 26 letters. So two times would be 2 multiplied by 26. Let me calculate that: 2 * 26 = 52. So that's 52 letters from the first two times.

Then, the problem says she writes two-fourths of it once. Wait, two-fourths is the same as a half, right? Because 2 divided by 4 is 0.5. So two-fourths of the alphabet would be (2/4)*26. Let me check that. 2/4 simplifies to 1/2, so 1/2 of 26 is 13. So she writes 13 letters here. So adding that to the previous total: 52 + 13 = 65 letters so far.

But then the problem says she re-writes everything she has already written. Hmm, what does ""everything she has already written"" refer to? Does that mean she rewrites all the letters she wrote in the previous steps combined? Let me think.

So after the first two full alphabets and the two-fourths (which is 13 letters), she then rewrites all of that again. So the total so far is 52 + 13 = 65 letters. Then she writes all of that again. Wait, does that mean she writes another 65 letters? So total would be 65 + 65 = 130?

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again carefully.

""Gabrielle is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full two times, writes two-fourths of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Gabrielle written in total?""

So the sequence is:

1. Writes the full alphabet two times. So 2 * 26 = 52 letters.

2. Then writes two-fourths of it once. That's (2/4)*26 = 13 letters.

3. Then re-writes everything she has already written. So everything up to that point.

So after step 1 and 2, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters. Then step 3 is rewriting those 65 letters again. So that's another 65 letters. So total letters would be 65 + 65 = 130.

Wait, but maybe ""everything she has already written"" refers to the entire alphabet each time? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the problem says she writes the full two times, then two-fourths once, then re-writes everything she has already written. So the ""everything"" would be the sum of all previous writings. So step 3 is adding another 65 letters. So total is 52 +13 +65 = 130.

Alternatively, maybe ""re-writes everything she has already written"" refers to the entire alphabet again, but that would be conflicting with the previous steps. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says she writes the alphabet in full two times. Then writes two-fourths once. Then re-writes everything she has already written. So ""everything she has already written"" would be the total letters from the first three steps? Wait, no. Let me parse the timeline:

First, she writes the full alphabet two times. Then, she writes two-fourths once. Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. So after the first two full writes and the partial write, she then does a rewrite of all those letters. So the first three steps are:

1. 2 times full alphabet: 2*26 = 52

2. 2/4 of alphabet once: 13

3. Rewriting the sum of steps 1 and 2: 52 +13 = 65, so she writes 65 again.

Total letters: 52 +13 +65 = 130.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be 130 letters.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's break it down step by step.

First two full alphabets: 26 * 2 = 52.

Third step: two-fourths (which is 13 letters) once: 13.

Fourth step: re-writes everything she has already written. So up to that point, she wrote 52 +13 = 65 letters. So she writes those 65 letters again. So total is 52 +13 +65 = 130.

Yes, that adds up. So the total number of letters Gabrielle has written is 130.
 
 Gabrielle's total letters written can be calculated by breaking down each step:

1. **Full alphabet twice**:  
   \( 2 \times 26 = 52 \) letters.

2. **Two-fourths of the alphabet once**:  
   \( \frac{2}{4} \times 26 = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \) letters.

3. **Rewriting everything previously written**:  
   After the first two steps, she had written \( 52 + 13 = 65 \) letters. Rewriting this amount adds another \( 65 \) letters.

**Total letters**:  
\( 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \).

**Answer**: 130 letters.",True
56,A carton of lemonade is 13 ozs of lemonade. Pavel drinks 4 cartons of lemonade. If lemonade has 8 calories per oz how many calories did he consume?,416,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total calories Pavel consumed by drinking lemonade. Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the carton size. Each carton is 13 ounces. Pavel drank 4 cartons. So, I need to find out the total ounces he drank first. That would be 13 oz per carton multiplied by 4 cartons. Let me do that math. 13 times 4... 13*4 is 52 ounces total. Right, because 10*4 is 40 and 3*4 is 12, so 40+12=52. So he drank 52 ounces of lemonade.

Next, the calories. The lemonade has 8 calories per ounce. So, to find the total calories, I need to multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce. That's 52 ounces times 8 calories per ounce. Let me calculate that. 52*8. Hmm, breaking it down: 50*8 is 400, and 2*8 is 16. So 400 +16 = 416. So 416 calories total.

Wait, let me double-check. 4 cartons at 13 oz each: 4*13=52. Then 52*8=416. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps are straightforward: multiply the number of cartons by ounces per carton to get total ounces, then multiply by calories per ounce to get total calories. So the answer should be 416 calories.
 
 Pavel drank 4 cartons of lemonade, with each carton containing 13 ounces. 

**Step 1: Calculate total ounces consumed**  
4 cartons × 13 oz/carton = **52 ounces**

**Step 2: Calculate total calories**  
52 ounces × 8 calories/ounce = **416 calories**

**Answer:** Pavel consumed **416 calories**.",True
57,"Viktor has 18 tubes of black paint and 16 tubes of magenta paint. Alejandro has 1/3 as many tubes of black paint as Viktor, and eight times as many tubes of magenta paint as Viktor. How many tubes of paint does Alejandro have?",134,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Viktor and Alejandro having paint tubes. I need to find out how many tubes of paint Alejandro has in total. Let me break it down step by step.

First, Viktor's paints. He has 18 tubes of black paint and 16 tubes of magenta. So that's straightforward. Now, Alejandro's paints are based on Viktor's quantities. The problem says Alejandro has 1/3 as many black paint tubes as Viktor. And for magenta, he has eight times as many as Viktor.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. So for black paint: Alejandro's black = (1/3) of Viktor's black. Viktor has 18, so Alejandro's black would be 18 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 18 divided by 3 is 6. So Alejandro has 6 black tubes.

Then for magenta: Alejandro has eight times Viktor's magenta. Viktor has 16 magenta tubes. So 16 multiplied by 8. Let me do that math. 16 times 8... 16*8 is 128. So Alejandro has 128 magenta tubes.

Now, to find the total number of tubes Alejandro has, I need to add his black and magenta tubes together. So 6 (black) plus 128 (magenta). 6 + 128 equals 134. So the total should be 134 tubes.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the black paint: 18 divided by 3 is indeed 6. For magenta: 16 times 8. Let's break that down. 10*8 is 80, and 6*8 is 48. Adding those gives 80+48=128. Then 6+128 is 134. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be 134.
 
 Alejandro's number of paint tubes is calculated as follows:

**Black Paint**:  
Alejandro has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of Viktor's 18 tubes.  
\( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) tubes.

**Magenta Paint**:  
Alejandro has \( 8 \times \) Viktor's 16 tubes.  
\( 8 \times 16 = 128 \) tubes.

**Total Tubes**:  
\( 6 \, (\text{black}) + 128 \, (\text{magenta}) = 134 \).

58,One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 60% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 31 days?,9920,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about trolls mining ore with different pickaxes, and we need to find out how much 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine in a month with 31 days. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the basic information given: one troll with a basic shovel mines 5 kg per day. Then, with a bronze pickaxe, they can mine twice as much. Wait, twice as much as the shovel? So if the shovel is 5 kg/day, then bronze would be 2 * 5 = 10 kg/day per troll. Got that part.

Then, the titanium pickaxe allows them to mine 60% more than with the bronze pickaxe. Oh right, so 60% more than the bronze's amount. So bronze is 10 kg/day. To calculate 60% more: 10 kg plus 60% of 10 kg. Let's compute that. 60% of 10 is 0.6 * 10 = 6. So adding that to the bronze amount gives 10 + 6 = 16 kg/day per troll with titanium.

Wait, let me confirm that. The problem says ""60% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe."" So yes, that's correct. So titanium is 10 * 1.6 = 16 kg per day per troll.

Now, the question is about 20 trolls using titanium pickaxes over 31 days. So each troll mines 16 kg/day. For one day, 20 trolls would mine 20 * 16 kg. Let me compute that. 20 * 16 is 320 kg/day. Then over 31 days, that's 320 * 31. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 320 * 30 is 9600, and 320 * 1 is 320, so total is 9600 + 320 = 9920 kg. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute per troll first. One troll with titanium mines 16 kg/day. Over 31 days, that's 16 * 31. Let's compute that. 16 * 30 is 480, plus 16 *1 = 16, so 496 kg per troll. Then multiply by 20 trolls: 496 * 20. 496 * 20 is 9920 kg. Yep, same result.

So the answer should be 9920 kg. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any steps. The key steps were:

1. Basic shovel: 5 kg/day.
2. Bronze pickaxe: 2x basic = 10 kg/day.
3. Titanium pickaxe: 60% more than bronze. So 10 + (0.6*10) = 16 kg/day.
4. For 20 trolls: 20 * 16 = 320 kg/day.
5. Over 31 days: 320 *31 = 9920 kg.

Everything checks out. I think that's correct.
 
 To determine how many kilograms of ore 20 trolls with titanium pickaxes can mine in a 31-day month, follow these steps:

1. **Basic Shovel Rate**:  
   One troll mines **5 kg/day** with a basic shovel.

2. **Bronze Pickaxe Rate**:  
   A bronze pickaxe doubles the basic rate:  
   \( 5 \, \text{kg/day} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{kg/day} \).

3. **Titanium Pickaxe Rate**:  
   A titanium pickaxe provides **60% more** than bronze:  
   \( 10 \, \text{kg/day} + (0.6 \times 10 \, \text{kg/day}) = 16 \, \text{kg/day} \).

4. **Total for 20 Trolls**:  
   Daily output for 20 trolls:  
   \( 20 \times 16 \, \text{kg/day} = 320 \, \text{kg/day} \).

5. **Monthly Output**:  
   Over 31 days:  
   \( 320 \, \text{kg/day} \times 31 \, \text{days} = 9,\!920 \, \text{kg} \).

59,"I have 18 liters of peach drink that are 2/3 water and I wish to add it to 21 liters of grape drink that is two-thirds water. But as I pour it, I spill 3 liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?",24,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about mixing two different drinks—peach and grape—each containing a certain amount of water. Then there's a spill, and we need to find out how much water is left in the remaining 36 liters. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, let's get the initial amounts straight. The peach drink is 18 liters, and it's 2/3 water. The grape drink is 21 liters, also two-thirds water. But then, when pouring the peach drink into the grape, 3 liters of peach are spilled. The total remaining is 36 liters. Wait, so the total after spilling should be 18 (peach) minus 3 spilled, which is 15 liters peach, plus 21 liters grape. So 15 +21=36 liters total. That makes sense because 18-3=15, plus 21 is 36. So the spill happens before mixing, right? So the peach drink is reduced by 3 liters before being added to the grape.

So the question is: how much water is in the remaining 36 liters? So we need to calculate the water from the remaining peach drink and the grape drink, then add them together.

Let's start with the peach drink. Originally, it's 18 liters with 2/3 water. So the water in peach before spilling is 18 * (2/3) = 12 liters. But then 3 liters are spilled. Wait, but when you spill 3 liters of the peach drink, how much water is lost? Because the spilled drink has the same proportion as the original. So the spilled 3 liters would also be 2/3 water. So the water lost would be 3*(2/3)=2 liters. Therefore, the remaining peach drink is 18-3=15 liters, and the water in that is 12 - 2 = 10 liters. Wait, but maybe another way: after spilling 3 liters, the remaining peach drink is 15 liters, which is still 2/3 water. So 15*(2/3)=10 liters of water. That's the same result. So either way, the remaining peach has 10 liters of water.

Then the grape drink is 21 liters, which is two-thirds water. So water in grape is 21*(2/3)=14 liters. Since there's no spillage mentioned for the grape drink, all 21 liters are added. So the total water is 10 (from peach) +14 (from grape) =24 liters.

Wait, but the problem says ""the remaining 36 liters""—so after spilling 3 liters of peach, the total volume is 15+21=36 liters. And the total water in that mixture is 24 liters. So the answer should be 24 liters of water. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original peach: 18 liters. 2/3 water: 12 liters water, 6 liters not. Spill 3 liters of peach. The spill would take away 2/3 water and 1/3 other, so 2 liters water lost. So remaining peach: 15 liters, 10 water, 5 not. Grape: 21 liters, 14 water, 7 not. Total water: 10+14=24. Total volume: 15+21=36. Yep, that adds up. So the answer is 24 liters of water.
 
 After spilling 3 liters of the peach drink, the remaining peach drink is 15 liters. Since the peach drink is 2/3 water, the water content in the remaining peach is \(15 \times \frac{2}{3} = 10\) liters. The grape drink remains 21 liters, with \(21 \times \frac{2}{3} = 14\) liters of water. Combining these, the total water in the 36-liter mixture is \(10 + 14 = 24\) liters.

**Answer:** 24 liters of water.",True
60,"Sanjay works a 7-hour shift each day, 3 days a week. He earns ₺17 per hour and gets a ₺582 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Sanjay make in June if the company performed very well for the whole month?",3756,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Sanjay works a 7-hour shift each day, 3 days a week. He earns ₺17 per hour and gets a ₺582 bonus each week if the company does well. The question is how much he made in June when the company performed very well the whole month. Hmm, right.

First, I need to figure out his regular earnings without the bonus, then add the weekly bonuses for the weeks in June. But wait, how many weeks are in June? Well, June has 30 days, right? So, 30 days divided by 7 days a week gives approximately 4.285 weeks. But usually, when calculating monthly payments based on weekly, you consider full weeks. Wait, but maybe the problem expects a certain approach here. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that there are 4 weeks in a month. But June has 30 days, which is exactly 4 weeks and 2 days. But depending on how the company's weeks are structured, those 2 days might count as a partial week. However, since the company performed well the entire month, maybe those two days are part of a week where the bonus is still given. Hmm, but the problem states that the bonus is given each week if the company performs well. So if there are 4 full weeks in June, he gets 4 bonuses. But if there's a partial week, does that count? The problem says the company performed well for the whole month, so maybe every week in June, including any partial one. Wait, but weeks are typically counted as starting on a specific day. For example, if June 1st is a Monday, then the weeks would be June 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and 29-30. That would be 5 weeks, but the last one is only 2 days. But the problem says he works 3 days a week. So maybe in that last partial week, he might not have worked all 3 days. Wait, but the problem states he works 3 days a week regardless of the days. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies it to 4 weeks in a month. Let me check both possibilities. Let's first calculate his regular earnings per week. He works 3 days a week, each day 7 hours. So 3 days * 7 hours = 21 hours per week. At ₺17 per hour, that's 21 * 17. Let me compute that. 20*17=340, 1*17=17, so total 340+17=357. So he makes ₺357 per week from his hourly wage. Then, if the company does well, he gets a ₺582 bonus each week. So total per week is 357 + 582 = 939. So per week, he makes ₺939 when the company performs

61,"Mohammed has a bag of pebbles with 62 inside. He tripped over root while carrying it and dropped 2/4 of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 18. When he went back home, he inspected the pebbles further. Five of them he picked up weren't pebbles, but actually beads so he got rid of it. How many pebbles did Mohammed end up with?",44,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many pebbles Mohammed ended up with. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, Mohammed starts with 62 pebbles in his bag. Then he trips over a root and drops 2/4 of them. Wait, 2/4 simplifies to 1/2, right? So he dropped half of his pebbles. Let me calculate that. Half of 62 is 62 divided by 2, which is 31. So he dropped 31 pebbles. That means he still has 62 - 31 = 31 pebbles left in the bag after dropping them. But then he scrambles to search for the dropped ones and finds 18. Hmm, wait, does that mean he picks up 18 of the 31 he dropped? So initially, after dropping, he had 31 left in the bag, and then he finds 18 of the dropped ones. So adding those 18 back to his bag. So total pebbles now would be 31 (remaining) + 18 (found) = 49 pebbles?

Wait, let me make sure. The problem says he dropped 2/4 (which is half) of them. So original 62, drops 31. So he's left with 31. Then he searches for the dropped ones and finds 18. So those 18 are in addition to the 31 he still had? Or does the 18 replace the ones he dropped? Wait, the wording is: he dropped 2/4 of them (so 31), then he searched for them and found 18. So he probably picked up 18 of the 31 he dropped. So the total pebbles he has now would be the 31 he didn't drop plus the 18 he found. So 31 + 18 = 49.

Then when he goes back home, he inspects the pebbles further. Five of the ones he picked up weren't pebbles but beads, so he gets rid of them. Wait, which five? The problem says ""five of them he picked up weren't pebbles"". So when he picked up the 18, five of those were beads. So he has to subtract those 5 from the 18 he found. So the 18 found pebbles actually include 5 beads. So the actual pebbles he recovered are 18 - 5 = 13. So adding that to the original 31 he had, that's 31 +13 = 44. Then, when he gets home, he removes those 5 beads. So the total pebbles would be 44.

Wait, let me check again. Let's go step by step.

Original pebbles: 62.

Drops 2/4 (half) of them: 62 / 2 = 31. So he drops 31, so he has 62 -31 = 31 left in the bag.

He searches for the dropped ones and finds 18. So he picks up 18 of the 31 he dropped. But among those 18, five are beads, not pebbles. So when he adds those 18 to his bag, he actually adds 18 -5 =13 pebbles. So the total pebbles now are 31 (original remaining) +13 (valid pebbles from the found) =44. Then he gets rid of the 5 beads, so those 5 are removed from the total. Wait, but if he added 18 (which included 5 beads) to his existing 31, then the total would be 31 +18 =49, but then he removes the 5 beads, so 49 -5 =44. Either way, same result.

So the final number of pebbles is 44.

Wait, let me confirm once more. Let's track each part:

Start: 62.

Drops half: 62 -31 =31 left in bag. 31 dropped.

Finds 18 of the dropped ones. But 5 are beads. So the pebbles he found are 18-5=13. So he adds 13 pebbles to his bag. So total pebbles: 31 +13=44. The beads are discarded, so they don't count. So yes, 44.

Alternatively, if he found 18 items, but 5 are beads, so he adds 18 items to his bag (31 +18=49), but then removes 5 beads, so 49-5=44. Either approach gives the same answer.

Therefore, the answer should be 44.
 
 Mohammed initially had **62 pebbles**. After tripping, he dropped **2/4 (half)** of them:  
\[ 62 \times \frac{1}{2} = 31 \text{ pebbles dropped} \]  
He retained **31 pebbles** in the bag.  

He later found **18** of the dropped items, but **5 were beads**. Thus, only **13 pebbles** were recovered:  
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ valid pebbles} \]  

Adding the recovered pebbles to the remaining ones:

62,"In a set of artist's cards, there are 30 purple cards, and 50% more yellow cards. Blue cards are as many as the sum of purple and yellow cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?",150,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many cards there are in total for purple, yellow, and blue. The problem says there are 30 purple cards. Then, there are 50% more yellow cards than purple. Blue cards are as many as the sum of purple and yellow. So, I need to calculate each color's count and add them up.

First, purple is straightforward: 30 cards. Now, yellow is 50% more than purple. Hmm, 50% of 30 is 15, right? So adding that to the original 30 gives 45 yellow cards. Wait, let me check that again. 50% more means the original amount plus half of it. So yes, 30 + 15 = 45. So yellow is 45.

Then blue cards are the sum of purple and yellow. Purple is 30, yellow is 45. So 30 + 45 = 75. So blue is 75 cards.

Now, to find the total, I add all three: 30 (purple) + 45 (yellow) + 75 (blue). Let's add them step by step. 30 + 45 is 75. Then 75 + 75 is 150. So the total number of cards is 150.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through each step again. Purple is given as 30. Yellow is 50% more than purple. 50% of 30 is indeed 15, so 30 +15=45. Blue is purple plus yellow, which is 30+45=75. Adding all together: 30+45=75, 75+75=150. Yep, that seems right. I think that's the answer.
 
 To determine the total number of cards:

1. **Purple cards**: Given as **30**.  
2. **Yellow cards**: 50% more than purple.  
   - 50% of 30 = \(0.5 \times 30 = 15\).  
   - Total yellow cards = \(30 + 15 = 45\).  
3. **Blue cards**: Equal to the sum of purple and yellow.  
   - \(30 + 45 = 75\).  
4. **Total cards**:  
   - \(30 \text{ (purple)} + 45 \text{ (yellow)} + 75 \text{ (blue)} = 150\).

Okay, let's see. The problem is about marbles. A student has 20 marbles, and his sister has 5 fewer than him. We need to find out how many they have together. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the student has 20 marbles. That's straightforward. Now, the sister has 5 fewer. So, fewer means subtraction, right? So sister's marbles = student's marbles minus 5. So that would be 20 minus 5. Let me calculate that. 20 minus 5 is 15. So the sister has 15 marbles.

Now, the question is asking how many they have together. That means we need to add the student's marbles and the sister's marbles. So total marbles = 20 (student) + 15 (sister). Let me add those. 20 plus 15 is 35. So together, they have 35 marbles.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The student has 20, sister has 5 less, so 15. Adding them gives 35. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward. No tricks or anything. So the answer should be 35.

Okay, let's see. So Beatriz has 9 jars of chocolate chips. Each jar can decorate 11 muffins. She wants to use up all the chocolate chips, so she needs to bake enough muffins that each one gets decorated with chips from those jars. Then, each rack holds 11 muffins. The question is how many racks she should bake.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to find out the total number of muffins she can decorate with all the jars. Since each jar is enough for 11 muffins, and there are 9 jars, the total muffins would be 9 multiplied by 11. Let me calculate that. 9 times 11 is 99. So she needs to bake 99 muffins to use up all the chocolate chips.

Now, each rack holds 11 muffins. So how many racks does she need to bake 99 muffins? To find the number of racks, I should divide the total number of muffins by the capacity of each rack. That's 99 divided by 11. Let me do that division. 99 divided by 11 is 9. So she needs 9 racks.

Wait, but let me double-check. If each rack holds 11 muffins, then 9 racks would be 9 times 11, which is 99. That matches the total number of muffins needed. So that makes sense. So the answer should be 9 racks worth of muffins.
 
 Beatriz has 9 jars, each sufficient for 11 muffins. To find the total muffins she needs to bake:  
**9 jars × 11 muffins/jar = 99 muffins**.

So the total lost income here would be 7 hours multiplied by ¥42 per hour. Let me calculate that. 7 times 42... 7*40 is 280, and 7*2 is 14, so 280+14=294. So she loses ¥294 by doing it herself.

On the other hand, if she hires the bookkeeper, she doesn't lose those 7 hours, so she can work and earn that ¥294. But she has to pay the bookkeeper ¥78. So the cost here is the bookkeeper's fee. So the net effect of hiring the bookkeeper would be the money she retains from not losing the contract work minus the cost of the bookkeeper. So ¥294 (the income she keeps) minus ¥78 (the bookkeeper's charge). Let me compute that. 294 minus 78. Let's see, 294-70 is 224, then subtract 8 more, which is 216. So ¥216.

Therefore, by hiring the bookkeeper, she would have ¥216 more than if she did the accounting herself. Wait, let me double-check. If she does it herself, she loses ¥294. If she hires, she pays ¥78. The difference between the two options is 294 (loss from doing herself) minus 78 (cost of hiring), which is 216. So yes, hiring the bookkeeper is ¥216 more beneficial. That makes sense. So the answer should be ¥216.
 
 Elena has two options: doing the accounting herself or hiring a bookkeeper. 

1. **Doing it herself**:  
   - She loses 7 hours of contract work.  
   - Lost income = 7 hours × ¥42/hour = **¥294**.  

2. **Hiring the bookkeeper**:  
   - Cost of bookkeeper = **¥78**.  
   - She retains the ¥294 income by working those 7 hours.  
   - Net gain = ¥294 (retained income) − ¥78 (bookkeeper cost) = **¥216**.  

**Difference**: Hiring the bookkeeper saves ¥294 − ¥78 = **¥216** compared to doing it herself.  

**Answer**: Elena will have **¥216** more if she hires the bookkeeper.",True
66,"Aisha has 47 light white spools of thread, 73 dark white spools of thread, 32 light brown spools of thread, and 88 dark brown spools of thread. What percent of the spools are white?",50,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the percentage of spools that are white. Aisha has four different types: light white, dark white, light brown, and dark brown. So first, I need to figure out how many white spools there are in total, then find what percentage that is of all the spools combined.

Wait, the white ones are both light white and dark white, right? Because sometimes people might categorize light and dark as separate, but in this case, the problem says ""white"" for both. So light white and dark white are both considered white. The brown ones are separate.

So let's break it down. The numbers given are:

- Light white: 47
- Dark white: 73
- Light brown: 32
- Dark brown: 88

First, add up all the white spools. That's 47 + 73. Let me calculate that. 47 plus 70 is 117, then plus 3 more is 120. So total white spools are 120.

Next, find the total number of all spools. That would be 47 + 73 + 32 + 88. Let me add them step by step. Let's group them as (47 +73) + (32 +88). We already know 47+73 is 120. Then 32 +88: 30+80 is 110, 2+8 is 10, so 120. Wait, 32+88 is 120? Wait, 32 plus 88: 88 plus 20 is 108, plus 12 is 120. Yes, that's correct. So total spools are 120 + 120 = 240.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 47+73 is 120, then 32+88 is 120. So total is 240. Hmm. Let me check again. 47+73: 40+70=110, 7+3=10, total 120. Then 32+88: 30+80=110, 2+8=10, so 120. So 120+120=240. Yes, that's correct.

So total spools are 240. White spools are 120. So the percentage is (120 / 240) * 100. That's 0.5 * 100 = 50%. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, 120 divided by 240 is 0.5, which is 50%. So the answer is 50%. But let me confirm once more. The white spools are light and dark white, which sum to 120. Total spools are 240. So half of them are white, which is 50%. That makes sense. So the percentage is 50%.
 
 To determine the percentage of white spools, first calculate the total number of white spools (light white + dark white) and the total number of all spools.

**White spools:**  
47 (light white) + 73 (dark white) = **120**

**Total spools:**  
47 + 73 + 32 (light brown) + 88 (dark brown) = 120 (white) + 120 (brown) = **240**

**Percentage of white spools:**  
(120 ÷ 240) × 100 = **50%**

**Answer:** 50%",True
67,"Mateo's van breaks down. The van weighs 2000 kilograms and he has groceries in it weighing 250 kilograms. He also has his 2 young friends who weigh 75 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the van is 3% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?",72,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Mateo's van broke down, and he needs to push it. The problem is asking how much force he needs to apply to move the van. Hmm, right. The key here is that the force required is 3% of the total weight. Alright, so first I need to figure out the total weight of everything in the van, and then take 3% of that.

Let me break it down. The van itself weighs 2000 kilograms. Then there are groceries adding 250 kilograms. Oh, and his two young friends. Each of them weighs 75 kilograms. So two friends would be 75 times 2. Let me calculate that. 75 times 2 is 150 kilograms. So adding all those components together: van (2000) + groceries (250) + friends (150). Let's add those up step by step.

2000 plus 250 is 2250. Then adding 150 to that gives 2250 + 150 = 2400 kilograms total. So the combined weight is 2400 kg. Now, the force needed is 3% of this total weight. Wait, but force is usually in newtons, right? Because weight is mass times gravity. Oh, wait, the problem mentions the weight in kilograms. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because kilograms are a unit of mass, not weight. Weight would be in newtons, calculated as mass (kg) multiplied by gravitational acceleration (approx 9.8 m/s2). But the problem states the van ""weighs"" 2000 kg, which is technically mass. But maybe in this context, they're using weight in kilograms as a force, which is not standard. Hmm. Wait, the problem says the force to move is 3% of the weight. So perhaps here, they are considering the total weight (as a force) as mass times gravity, but then taking 3% of that. Or maybe the problem is simplifying things by just taking 3% of the total mass in kilograms and expressing the force in kilograms-force? That's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, but in real physics, the force required to move an object (assuming overcoming static friction) would be the coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force. The normal force here is the weight, which is mass times gravity. So if the coefficient is 3%, then the force needed would be 0.03 * (total mass) * g. But the problem states ""the force to move the van is 3% of the weight"". So maybe they are simplifying it, treating weight as mass (which is incorrect in real terms), but perhaps in the problem's context, they just want 3% of the total mass in kg, converted to force. Wait, but force would be in newtons. Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected in kilograms-force, which is a non-SI unit where 1 kgf is the weight of 1 kg mass under standard gravity. So 1 kgf = 9.8 N. But maybe the problem is just expecting 3% of the total mass, expressed in kgf. Hmm.

But the problem's wording says ""the force to move the van is 3% of the weight"". So if the weight is in kilograms (which is actually mass), then 3% of that would be 0.03 * total mass. But that's not correct in terms of units. Alternatively, if the weight is properly calculated as mass * gravity, then 3% of that would be 0.03 * mass * gravity. But then the answer would be in newtons. However, the problem doesn't specify the units for the force. Wait, the problem says ""how much force does he need to push the van?"" So the answer is expected to be a force. But given that all the weights are given in kilograms, perhaps the problem is using ""weight"" in a non-technical sense, meaning mass, and the answer is expected in kilograms-force. So 3% of the total mass in kilograms, giving the answer in kgf. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting a numerical value in kilograms, treating the force as a percentage of the mass. That's possible, but not technically correct. But given that it's a math problem, perhaps they just want 3% of the total mass, regardless of units. Let me check the problem again.

The problem states: ""the force to move the van is 3% of the weight"". So if the weight is 2400 kg (as calculated), then 3% of that is 72 kg. But kg is mass, not force. So perhaps the answer is 72 kg-force. But maybe the problem is just expecting 72 as the numerical value, with the unit being kgf. Alternatively, maybe the problem is incorrect in units, but expects the answer as 72 kg. But that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using ""weight"" correctly as a force, so the total weight is (2000 + 250 + 150) kg * 9.8 m/s2. Then 3% of that would be the force needed. But that would be in newtons. Let's compute that.

Total mass: 2000 + 250 + 150 = 2400 kg. Weight = 2400 kg * 9.8 m/s2 = 23520 N. Then 3% of that is 0.03 * 23520 = 705.6 N. So the answer would be 705.6 newtons. But the problem doesn't specify units. However, the problem gives all weights in kilograms, which is mass, not force. So perhaps the problem is making a mistake in terminology, using ""weight"" when they mean mass, and thus the answer is 3% of 2400 kg, which is 72 kg. But kg is not a unit of force. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using ""weight"" in the colloquial sense, where people say ""weight"" but mean mass, and the force is calculated as 3% of that mass. But that's not correct. However, given that this is a math problem, perhaps the intended answer is simply 3% of the total mass, regardless of units. Let's see. The total mass is 2400 kg. 3% of that is 0.03 * 2400 = 72. So 72 kg? But that's a mass, not a force. Unless the answer is in kgf (kilograms-force), which is equivalent to 72 * 9.8 N, but that's 705.6 N, which matches the previous calculation. So maybe the problem expects the answer in kgf, which would be 72. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is from a context where they use ""force"" in terms of kilograms, which is technically incorrect, but commonly done in some non-scientific contexts. For example, in some countries, people might refer to force in kilograms, meaning kgf. So the answer would be 72 kgf. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the problem mentions ""force"" and the weights are given in kilograms, perhaps the intended answer is 72, with the unit being kilograms-force (kgf). Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in newtons, then 705.6 N. But since the problem didn't specify units, but all input is in kilograms, maybe the answer is 72, with the unit being kg? But that's not a force unit. This is a bit of a problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed to ignore the unit conversion and just take 3% of the total mass, giving the answer in the same unit as the weight, which is kg. But that's not correct in real physics. However, given that this is a math problem, perhaps that's the approach. Let me check the problem again. It says ""the force to move the van is 3% of the weight"". If ""weight"" here is considered as a force (in newtons), then the answer is 3% of that. But since the problem gives the weight in kilograms (which is mass), perhaps the problem is making a mistake and wants 3% of the total mass. So the answer would be 72 kg, but that's not a force. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using ""weight"" in the correct sense, so the total weight is 2400 kg * g, and 3% of that. But then the answer would be in newtons. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the answer is 72, with the unit being kilograms, but that's technically incorrect. Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer in newtons, but since the problem didn't mention gravity, maybe they just want 3% of the total mass. Hmm.

Given that this is a math problem, not a physics problem, perhaps the intended answer is simply 3% of the total mass, which is 72. So the answer is 72 kilograms-force. But the problem might just state the numerical value as 72, with the unit being unspecified. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in newtons, but since they didn't provide the value of g, perhaps they just want 72. But that's not correct. Wait, but maybe the problem is using ""weight"" as mass, and the force is 3% of that mass, so 72 kg. But that's not a force. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using ""weight"" in the correct sense, and the answer is in newtons. Let's compute that. Total mass = 2400 kg. Weight = 2400 kg * 9.81 m/s2 ≈ 23544 N. 3% of that is 0.03 * 23544 ≈ 706.32 N. So approximately 706.32 newtons. But the problem doesn't mention gravity, so maybe they expect us to ignore it and just take 3% of the mass. That

68,It takes Sakura 28 minutes to finish a brain teaser and 4 minutes to finish a chess puzzle. Over the vacation she solved 4 brain teasers and 7 chess puzzles. How much time did she spend playing these games?,140,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together," Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Sakura spending time on brain teasers and chess puzzles over her vacation. We need to find out the total time she spent on both activities. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's parse the information given. It says that Sakura takes 28 minutes to finish a brain teaser. So each brain teaser is 28 minutes. Then, she takes 4 minutes for a chess puzzle. So each chess puzzle is 4 minutes. She solved 4 brain teasers and 7 chess puzzles. The question is asking for the total time she spent on both types of games.

Alright, so the approach here is probably to calculate the time spent on each type of game separately and then add them together. That makes sense. So for the brain teasers: 4 brain teasers, each taking 28 minutes. So 4 multiplied by 28. Then for the chess puzzles: 7 puzzles, each taking 4 minutes. So 7 multiplied by 4. Then add those two results to get the total time.

Let me write that out. Let's start with the brain teasers. 4 times 28. Hmm, 28 times 4. Let me compute that. 28 times 4: 20 times 4 is 80, and 8 times 4 is 32. So 80 + 32 is 112. So 4 brain teasers take 112 minutes total.

Now for the chess puzzles. 7 puzzles times 4 minutes each. 7 times 4 is 28. So 28 minutes total for the chess puzzles.

Now add those two together: 112 minutes plus 28 minutes. Let's see, 112 + 28. 112 + 20 is 132, then plus 8 is 140. So total time is 140 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the brain teasers: 4 x 28. 28 x 2 is 56, so 56 x 2 is 112. That's correct. For the chess puzzles: 7 x 4 is 28. Then 112 + 28: 112 + 20 is 132, plus 8 is 140. Yep, that adds up. So the total time she spent is 140 minutes.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe converting minutes to hours or something? But the question asks for time spent, and the answer is expected in minutes, I think. Since both individual times are in minutes, adding them gives total minutes. So 140 minutes is the answer. That seems right.

Alternatively, someone might think to check if there's a trick, like maybe overlapping times or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It just says she solved 4 brain teasers and 7 chess puzzles. So it's a straightforward multiplication and addition problem. No hidden steps here.

Another check: Let's redo the math. 4 brain teasers at 28 each: 28*4. 28*4: 20*4=80, 8*4=32. 80+32=112. Correct. 7 chess puzzles at 4 each: 7*4=28. 112+28=140. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be 140 minutes.
 
 Sakura spent time on two types of games: brain teasers and chess puzzles. To find the total time:

1. **Brain Teasers**:  
   - Time per brain teaser: 28 minutes  
   - Number solved: 4  
   - Total time: \(4 \times 28 = 112\) minutes  

2. **Chess Puzzles**:

69,"On Tuesday, Ibrahim wants to exercise for seven times the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 55 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?",546,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Ibrahim wanting to exercise on Tuesday for seven times the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. I need to figure out how many minutes he needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal.

First, let me parse the information given. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday, he did 55 minutes. The goal for Tuesday is seven times the combined total of Monday and Sunday. So the steps here would be: add the minutes from Sunday and Monday together, then multiply that sum by seven to get the required time for Tuesday.

Wait, let me make sure I'm understanding correctly. The problem says ""seven times the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined."" So combined here means the sum of Monday and Sunday's exercise times. So first, sum Sunday (23) and Monday (55), then multiply by seven. That product will be the target for Tuesday.

Let me write that out step by step. 

First, calculate the combined time for Sunday and Monday. That's 23 minutes plus 55 minutes. Let me add those: 23 + 55. Let's see, 20 + 50 is 70, and 3 + 5 is 8, so 70 + 8 = 78. So combined, he exercised 78 minutes on those two days.

Then, Tuesday's goal is seven times that. So 78 multiplied by 7. Hmm, let me compute that. 70*7 is 490, and 8*7 is 56. Adding those together: 490 +56 = 546. So 78*7=546. Therefore, Ibrahim needs to exercise 546 minutes on Tuesday.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my math again to be sure. Let's verify the addition first. 23 +55. 23 +50 is 73, plus 5 more is 78. That's correct. Then 78*7. Breaking it down: 7*70=490, 7*8=56. 490+56=546. Yes, that's right. So the calculation checks out.

Alternatively, maybe I can do the multiplication another way to confirm. Let's see, 78*7. 7 times 70 is 490. 7 times 8 is 56. Adding them gives 490 +56. 490+50 is 540, plus 6 is 546. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 546 minutes. That's over nine hours, which seems like a lot for a day's exercise, but maybe he's training for something intense. Anyway, according to the problem's parameters, that's the required time.
 
 To determine how many minutes Ibrahim needs to exercise on Tuesday, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the combined exercise time for Sunday and Monday:**
   - Sunday: 23 minutes
   - Monday: 55 minutes
   - Total = 23 + 55 = **78 minutes**

2. **Multiply the combined time by 7 to find Tuesday's goal:**
   - 78 minutes × 7 = **546 minutes**

70,"A painter works for 2 weeks every month and for 6 days every week. If he gets paid ₣150 every day, how much does he earn if he works for a year?",21600,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about a painter who works 2 weeks every month and 6 days each week. He gets paid 150 francs per day. We need to find out how much he earns in a year. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many days he works each month. Since he works 2 weeks per month and each week has 6 days, that would be 2 weeks multiplied by 6 days per week. So 2 * 6 = 12 days per month. Wait, but wait a second—is that accurate? Because a month isn't exactly 4 weeks, but maybe the problem is assuming each month is exactly 4 weeks? Or are they just saying 2 weeks regardless of the actual month length? The problem says ""works for 2 weeks every month,"" so maybe each month is considered to have exactly 2 weeks of work. But each of those weeks is 6 days. So per month, it's 2 * 6 = 12 days.

Then, for a year, there are 12 months. So total days per year would be 12 days/month * 12 months = 144 days. Then multiply by the daily rate of 150 francs. So 144 * 150. Let me calculate that. 144 * 100 is 14,400, and 144 * 50 is 7,200. Adding those together gives 14,400 + 7,200 = 21,600 francs. 

Wait, but hold on. Is there another way this could be interpreted? For example, maybe the 2 weeks per month are actual weeks, so 14 days, but he works 6 days each week. Wait, no, the problem says he works 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week. So each week he works 6 days. So 2 weeks per month, each week being 6 days. So 2 * 6 = 12 days per month. That seems right. Then 12 months, so 12 * 12 = 144 days. 144 * 150 = 21,600. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a week as 7 days, but he works 6 days each week. But the problem states he works 2 weeks every month. So if a week is 7 days, but he works 6 days each week, then per month it's 2 weeks * 6 days = 12 days, same as before. So regardless of how the week is structured, the calculation remains the same. So the answer should be 21,600 francs.

I think that's it. Let me just check the math again. 2 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 12 days/month. 12 months * 12 days = 144 days. 144 * 150. Let's compute 150 * 144. Breaking it down: 100 * 144 = 14,400; 50 * 144 = 7,200. Sum them: 21,600. Yep, that's correct. So the painter earns ₣21,600 in a year.
 
 The painter works 2 weeks each month, with each week consisting of 6 workdays. 

**Calculations:**
- **Days per month:** 2 weeks/month × 6 days/week = 12 days/month  
- **Days per year:** 12 days/month × 12 months = 144 days/year  
- **Annual earnings:** 144 days × ₣150/day = ₣21,600

71,"Yuki is feeding his livestock hay. Each alpaca needs 9 kg, and each horse needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. If there are 35 alpacas and 22 horses, how many kg of hay does Yuki need?",579,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Yuki is feeding his livestock, which includes alpacas and horses. I need to figure out how much hay he needs in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says each alpaca needs 9 kg of hay. There are 35 alpacas. So for the alpacas alone, the total hay needed would be 35 multiplied by 9 kg. Let me calculate that. 35 times 9... Hmm, 30 times 9 is 270, and 5 times 9 is 45, so adding those together gives 315 kg. So the alpacas need 315 kg of hay.

Now, the horses. Each horse needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. Wait, the alpacas are each getting 9 kg. So twice that would be 18 kg. Then subtract 6 kg. So 18 minus 6 is 12 kg per horse. Let me double-check that. Twice 9 is 18, subtract 6 gives 12. Yep, that's right. So each horse needs 12 kg of hay.

There are 22 horses. So the total hay for the horses is 22 multiplied by 12 kg. Let me compute that. 20 times 12 is 240, and 2 times 12 is 24. Adding those gives 240 + 24 = 264 kg. So the horses need 264 kg.

Now, to find the total hay needed, I just add the alpacas' total and the horses' total. That's 315 kg plus 264 kg. Let's add those. 300 + 200 is 500, 15 + 64 is 79. So 500 + 79 equals 579 kg. Wait, but let me check again. 315 + 264: 300 + 200 = 500, 15 + 64 = 79. So yes, 579 kg total.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations once more to be sure. For the alpacas: 35 * 9. Let's do 35 * 10 = 350, then subtract 35, which is 315. Correct. For the horses: 22 * 12. 22 * 10 is 220, 22 * 2 is 44. 220 +44 = 264. Correct. Then 315 +264. 300+200=500, 15+64=79. 500+79=579. Yep, that's right.

So Yuki needs a total of 579 kg of hay.
 
 Yuki needs to calculate the total hay required for both alpacas and horses.

**Step 1: Hay for Alpacas**  
Each alpaca needs **9 kg**. With **35 alpacas**:  
\[ 35 \times 9 = 315 \, \text{kg} \]

**Step 2: Hay for Horses**  
Each horse needs **6 kg less than twice an alpaca's amount**:  
\[ 2 \times 9 - 6 = 18 - 6 = 12 \, \text{kg/horse} \]  
For **22 horses**:  
\[ 22 \times 12 = 264 \, \text{kg} \]

**Step 3: Total Hay Required**  
Add the totals:

72,Diego was a pen pal with 7 people. He stopped being penpals with 3 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 9 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 5 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,9,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Diego used to have 7 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 3 of them. So now he has 7 minus 3, which is 4 pen pals left. Right?

Each of these 4 pen pals sends him 3 letters a week. And each letter is 9 pages long. So, first, I need to figure out how many letters Diego receives in total each week. Since each pen pal sends 3 letters, that's 4 pen pals times 3 letters each. 4 times 3 is 12 letters per week. But wait, each of those letters is 9 pages. So the total number of pages he receives is 12 letters multiplied by 9 pages per letter. Let me calculate that: 12 * 9 = 108 pages per week.

But the problem says he responds ""in kind."" Hmm, ""in kind"" probably means he sends back the same number of letters or pages. So if each of his pen pals sends him 3 letters a week, he must send 3 letters back to each of them. So that's again 4 pen pals times 3 letters each, which is 12 letters. Each of his responses would also be 9 pages long, right? Because the original letters are 9 pages, so responding in kind would mean each response is also 9 pages. So the total pages he needs to write would be 12 letters * 9 pages = 108 pages per week.

Wait, but maybe ""in kind"" refers to the number of pages instead of letters? Let me think. If someone sends a 9-page letter, responding in kind might mean sending a 9-page reply. So regardless of how many letters, the total pages would match. But the original problem says ""they each send 3 letters a week that are 9 pages long."" So each of the 3 letters is 9 pages. So each pen pal sends 3 letters, each 9 pages. So per pen pal, that's 3 * 9 = 27 pages per week. So total incoming pages per week from all pen pals would be 4 * 27 = 108 pages. Then, responding in kind would mean he sends back 108 pages in total each week. But how does that break down into letters? Maybe the number of letters isn't important as long as the total pages match. But the problem states he responds in kind, so maybe he sends the same number of letters with the same number of pages. So each of his responses is 3 letters per week, each 9 pages. So per pen pal, he sends 3 letters, each 9 pages, totaling 27 pages per pen pal. So 4 pen pals * 27 pages = 108 pages total. Either way, the total pages he writes per week is 108 pages.

Now, he can write a page every 5 minutes. So the total time he spends is 108 pages * 5 minutes per page. Let's compute that: 108 * 5 = 540 minutes. Then, converting minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 540 / 60 = 9 hours. So he spends 9 hours a week writing.

Wait, let me double-check. Let's go step by step again.

1. Number of pen pals now: 7 - 3 = 4. Correct.
2. Each sends 3 letters a week, each letter 9 pages. So per pen pal: 3 letters * 9 pages = 27 pages. Total incoming: 4 * 27 = 108 pages. Responding in kind would mean he sends back 108 pages total. So he writes 108 pages a week. Correct.
3. Time per page: 5 minutes. Total minutes: 108 * 5 = 540. Convert to hours: 540 / 60 = 9. So 9 hours. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured differently. Let's see. If each of the 4 pen pals sends 3 letters a week, each 9 pages, then each week he receives 3 letters from each, and he responds to each letter with a letter of the same length. So for each letter received, he writes a reply of 9 pages. So number of replies: same as number of letters received. Which is 4 pen pals * 3 letters each = 12 letters. Each reply is 9 pages, so 12 * 9 = 108 pages. Then same as before. So yes, 108 pages. Time is 108 *5 =540 minutes, 9 hours. So the answer is 9 hours.
 
 Diego has 4 remaining pen pals after stopping correspondence with 3. Each sends 3 letters weekly, each 9 pages long. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Total Pages Received Weekly**:  
   \(4 \text{ pen pals} \times 3 \text{ letters} \times 9 \text{ pages} = 108 \text{ pages}\).

2. **Response Requirement**:  
   Responding ""in kind"" means Diego writes 108 pages weekly (matching the total pages received).

3. **Time Calculation**:  
   - Writing 1 page takes 5 minutes.  
   - Total minutes: \(108 \text{ pages} \times 5 \text{ minutes/page} = 540 \text{ minutes}\).  
   - Convert to hours: \(540 \div 60 = 9 \text{ hours}\).

73,Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 75 years. Diego's uncle saw the Comet when he was 46 years old. Diego saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. How old was Diego when he saw the Comet for the first time?,17,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about Comet Hyakutake, which orbits the sun every 75 years. Diego's uncle saw the comet when he was 46 years old. Then Diego saw the comet a second time when he was twice the age his uncle was when he saw it. We need to find out how old Diego was when he first saw the comet.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the comet appears every 75 years. So if someone sees it once, the next time it comes around would be 75 years later. But wait, Diego's uncle saw it once, and Diego saw it a second time. Wait, but if the comet comes every 75 years, then the time between the uncle seeing it and Diego seeing it again must be a multiple of 75 years. But how does that relate to their ages?

Let me start by setting up some variables. Let's say the year when Diego's uncle saw the comet is year X. At that time, the uncle was 46 years old. Then, the comet returns 75 years later, so the next appearance would be in year X + 75. But Diego saw the comet a second time when he was twice the age his uncle was when he saw it. Wait, the uncle was 46 when he saw it, so twice that age would be 92. So Diego was 92 when he saw it the second time. But wait, the problem says Diego saw it a second time. That implies he saw it once before. So the first time Diego saw it would be 75 years before the second time. But if he was 92 when he saw it the second time, then the first time he saw it would be 92 - 75 = 17 years old. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the timeline. Let's think again. The uncle saw the comet when he was 46. Let's call that time T. Then, the comet comes again at T + 75 years. But Diego saw the comet a second time when he was twice his uncle's age when the uncle saw it (which was 46). So Diego's age at his second sighting is 2*46 = 92. So Diego was 92 when he saw it the second time. Now, the comet's period is 75 years, so the first time Diego saw it would be 75 years before that second sighting. Therefore, Diego's age at first sighting would be 92 - 75 = 17. So the answer would be 17. But wait, does that make sense? Let's check the timeline again.

Wait, but how old was Diego when his uncle saw the comet? Let's see. Let's assume that the uncle saw the comet in year Y when he was 46. Then, the next time the comet comes is Y + 75. But Diego saw it a second time at age 92. So that second time would be in year Y + 75 + k*75, where k is some integer. Wait, but maybe the second time Diego saw it is Y + 75. Let's think about the possible time differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncle saw the comet at time T (when he was 46), and Diego saw it again (second time) at time T + 75. But Diego's age at that time (T + 75) is twice the uncle's age when he saw it (which was 46). So Diego's age at T + 75 is 92. Therefore, Diego was born in year (T + 75) - 92. His first sighting would be when the comet was there before T + 75. Since the comet comes every 75 years, the previous one would be at T + 75 - 75 = T. But wait, that's when the uncle saw it. So if Diego was born in (T +75) -92, then his birth year is T +75 -92. So how old was Diego at time T? Let's compute T - (T +75 -92) = 17. So Diego was 17 years old when the comet was there at time T. But that's when his uncle saw it. So that would mean Diego's first sighting was at age 17, which is the same time his uncle saw it when he was 46. But that would mean that Diego and his uncle saw the comet together when Diego was 17 and the uncle was 46. Then, the next time the comet comes is 75 years later, when Diego would be 17 +75=92, which matches the problem statement. So that makes sense. Therefore, Diego was 17 when he first saw the comet.

Wait, but the problem says Diego saw the comet a second time when he was twice his uncle's age when the uncle saw it. So the uncle was 46 when he saw it, so twice that is 92. So Diego's second sighting is at 92. Since the comet comes every 75 years, his first sighting was 75 years earlier, so 92 -75=17. That seems correct. So the answer is 17.

But let me check again. Let's say in year Y, the uncle is 46 and sees the comet. Then the next comet is in Y+75. In Y+75, Diego is 92. So Diego was born in Y+75 -92. Therefore, in year Y, Diego's age would be Y - (Y+75 -92) = Y - Y -75 +92 = 17. So in year Y, Diego is 17, which is when the uncle is 46. So they both saw the comet together in year Y. Then, the next comet is in Y+75, when Diego is 17+75=92. So that's correct. Therefore, Diego's first sighting was at 17, and the second at 92. So the answer is 17.
 
 Diego was 17 years old when he first saw Comet Hyakutake. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Uncle's Observation**: Diego's uncle saw the comet at age 46. Let this occur in year \( Y \).

2. **Comet's Orbital Period**: The comet returns every 75 years. The next appearance after \( Y \) is in \( Y + 75 \).

3. **Diego's Second Sighting**: Diego saw the comet a second time when he was twice his uncle's age during the uncle's observation. Since the uncle was 46, Diego's age at his second sighting is \( 2 \times 46 = 92 \). This second sighting occurs in \( Y + 75 \).

4. **Calculating Diego's Birth Year**: If Diego was 92 in \( Y + 75 \), he was born in \( (Y + 75) - 92 = Y - 17 \).

5. **First Sighting Age**: In year \( Y \), Diego's age is \( Y - (Y - 17) = 17 \). Thus, Diego was 17 when he first saw the comet alongside his uncle.

74,"There are 172 fourth-graders at Pine Valley School. 83 of them are girls. On Thursday, 3 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. How many fourth grade boys were at Pine Valley School on Thursday?",85,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many fourth-grade boys were present at Pine Pine Valley School on Thursday. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the total number of fourth-graders is 172. Out of these, 83 are girls. So, to find the number of boys in total, I can subtract the number of girls from the total. That makes sense because total students minus girls should equal boys. Let me write that down:

Total boys = Total students - Total girls
Total boys = 172 - 83

Hmm, let's calculate that. 172 minus 80 is 92, and then subtract 3 more, which would be 89. So there are 89 boys in total.

But wait, the question is about how many boys were present on Thursday. The problem states that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent that day. So, to find the number of boys present, I need to subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys.

Boys present = Total boys - Absent boys
Boys present = 89 - 4

That's straightforward. 89 minus 4 is 85. So, 85 boys were present on Thursday.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. The girls' absence was 3, but since the question is about the boys, that part isn't directly relevant. But just to confirm, the total students absent would be 3 girls + 4 boys = 7, but the problem doesn't ask about total absences. So yes, focusing on the boys: total boys 89 minus 4 absent equals 85 present. That seems right.
 
 To determine how many fourth-grade boys were present at Pine Valley School on Thursday:

1. **Calculate the total number of boys:**
   - Total fourth-graders = 172  
   - Girls = 83  
   - Boys = Total - Girls = 172 - 83 = **89 boys**

2. **Adjust for absences on Thursday:**
   - Boys absent = 4  
   - Boys present = Total boys - Absent boys = 89 - 4 = **85**

75,"There are currently 19 red balls, 29 green balls, and 48 yellow balls in the shop. Red balls cost ¥13, yellow balls cost ¥6, and green balls cost ¥7. How much will the shop have received after all the balls are sold?",738,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total amount the shop will receive after selling all their balls. There are three types of balls: red, green, and yellow, each with different quantities and prices. I need to find the total revenue from selling all of them.

First, I should note down the given data to avoid confusion. Let me list each type with their respective numbers and prices.

Red balls: 19 in total, each costs ¥13. So the total money from red balls would be 19 multiplied by 13. Let me calculate that. 19 times 10 is 190, and 19 times 3 is 57. Adding those together gives 190 + 57 = 247. So red balls contribute ¥247.

Next, green balls. There are 29 green balls, each priced at ¥7. To find the total for green, multiply 29 by 7. Hmm, 30 times 7 is 210, but since there are 29, subtract 7. So 210 - 7 = 203. So green balls add ¥203 to the total.

Then, yellow balls. There are 48 of them, each at ¥6. So 48 multiplied by 6. Let's break that down. 40 times 6 is 240, and 8 times 6 is 48. Adding those gives 240 + 48 = 288. So yellow balls contribute ¥288.

Now, to get the total amount the shop receives, I need to add up the three amounts: 247 (red) + 203 (green) + 288 (yellow). Let's add them step by step. First, 247 + 203. Let's see, 200 + 200 is 400, and 47 + 3 is 50. So 400 + 50 = 450. Then add 288 to that. 450 + 288. 400 + 200 is 600, 50 + 88 is 138. So 600 + 138 = 738. Wait, that seems right. Let me check again. 247 + 203 is 450. Then 450 + 288: 450 + 200 is 650, plus 88 is 738. Yes, that adds up to ¥738.

Wait, let me verify each multiplication again to be sure. For red balls: 19*13. Let's do 20*13=260, minus 1*13=13. So 260-13=247. Correct. Green: 29*7. 30*7=210, minus 1*7=7, so 203. Correct. Yellow: 48*6. 50*6=300, minus 2*6=12, so 300-12=288. Correct. Then adding all three: 247+203=450, 450+288=738. Yes, that's the total. So the shop will receive ¥738 after selling all the balls.
 
 The shop's total revenue from selling all the balls is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each ball type by its respective price and summing the results.

- **Red balls**: \(19 \times 13 = 247\) ¥  
- **Green balls**: \(29 \times 7 = 203\) ¥  
- **Yellow balls**: \(48 \times 6 = 288\) ¥  

**Total Revenue**: \(247 + 203 + 288 = 738\) ¥  

**Answer**: The shop will receive ¥738 after all balls are sold.",True
76,"Wei caught 4 trouts last Sunday, the first trout he caught weighs 70 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 33 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 32 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs €1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?",167,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So Wei caught 4 trouts last Sunday. The first one is 70 kg, the second is 33 kg, and the last one is 32 kg. Wait, wait, that's three trouts. The problem says he caught four. Hmm, maybe there's a typo or I misread. Let me check again.

The problem states: ""the first trout he caught weighs 70 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 33 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 32 kilograms."" So first, second, last. But there are four trouts total. So maybe the third trout's weight isn't mentioned? Or perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the problem is structured as first, second, third, fourth. But the description only gives three weights. Let me read again. ""the first trout he caught weighs 70 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 33 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 32 kilograms."" So first, second, last. Since there are four trouts, the third one's weight is missing. Or maybe ""last"" refers to the fourth, so the third is missing. That's confusing.

Wait, the problem says he caught 4 trouts. The first is 70 kg, second is 33 kg, and the last is 32 kg. So that leaves the third trout's weight unmentioned. But how can we calculate the total if we don't know the third trout's weight? Unless there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg? But the problem says the last one is 32 kg. Wait, maybe the third and fourth are both 32 kg? But that's not stated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to list all four trouts. Let me check again. The first trout is 70 kg, second is 33 kg, and the last is 32 kg. So that's three weights. But there are four trouts. So one trout's weight is missing. Unless ""last"" here refers to the fourth, but then the third is missing. So perhaps the problem has an error here. But maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is written correctly, but I need to figure out the missing weight. Wait, no, the problem doesn't give any other information. Wait, maybe the problem is correct and there's a miscalculation. Let me read again.

The problem says: Wei caught 4 trouts. The first is 70 kg, second is 33 kg, and the last is 32 kg. So first, second, third, fourth. The last (fourth) is 32 kg. Then the third trout's weight is missing. But the problem doesn't mention it. So how can we compute the total weight? Unless there's a typo. Maybe the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say that the third and fourth are 32 kg each. But the way it's written is ""the last trout he caught weighs 32 kg"". So the fourth trout is 32 kg. Then the third trout's weight is missing. But the problem doesn't provide that information. So this seems like an error in the problem statement. But maybe I'm supposed to assume that the third trout's weight is zero? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe there's a typo where ""last two"" were intended. For example, maybe the third and fourth are 32 kg each, but the problem says ""last trout"" (singular). 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the third trout is 32 kg, making the total four trouts: first (70), second (33), third (32), and fourth (32). But that's not how it's written. The problem says ""the last trout he caught weighs 32 kg"". So if there are four trouts, the last one is the fourth, which is 32 kg. Then the third trout's weight is missing. So the problem is missing the weight of the third trout. Therefore, the problem as stated is incomplete. But since this is a math problem, perhaps there's a different way to interpret it. Maybe the problem intended to list all four trouts but made a mistake. For example, maybe the first is 70, second 33, third 32, and fourth 32. But the problem says ""last"" which would be the fourth. So maybe the third is missing. But without that information, we can't compute the total. 

Wait, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm miscounting. Let's list them:

Total trouts: 4.

1st: 70 kg

2nd: 33 kg

3rd: ?

4th (last): 32 kg

So the third trout's weight is unknown. Therefore, the problem can't be solved as stated. Unless there's a typo. For example, maybe the problem meant that the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg. But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say that the third and fourth trouts each weigh 32 kg. But the problem says ""the last trout"" (singular) weighs 32 kg. So that's the fourth. Then the third is missing. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake in the number of trouts. Maybe he caught three trouts, but the problem says four. That would make the problem incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and the user expects me to notice that the total trouts are four, but only three weights are given, making the problem unsolvable. But that seems unlikely. Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Wait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, but the user made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says: ""the first trout he caught weighs 70 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 33 kilograms, and the last trout he caught weighs 32 kilograms."" So first, second, last. If there are four trouts, then the third and fourth would be the last two. But the problem says ""the last trout"" (singular) is 32 kg. So fourth is 32 kg. Then third is missing. So the problem is missing the weight of the third trout. Therefore, the problem can't be solved as stated. 

But since this is a problem presented to me, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe ""last"" refers to the third and fourth. But that's not grammatically correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to list all four, but there's a typo. For example, maybe the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg. Then total would be 70 +33 +32 +32 = 167 kg. Then 167 euros. But the problem states the last trout is 32 kg. So if there are four trouts, the fourth is 32 kg. Then the third is missing. So unless the third trout's weight is zero, which is impossible, the problem is missing data. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the third and fourth trouts each weigh 32 kg. Then total would be 70+33+32+32= 167 kg. But the problem says ""the last trout"" which is singular. So that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake in the number of trouts. If he caught three trouts, then the total would be 70+33+32=135 kg, which would be 135 euros. But the problem says four trouts. 

Hmm. This is a bit of a puzzle. Since the problem is presented as a math problem to solve, perhaps there's an assumption that the user made a typo, and the third trout is 32 kg, making the fourth also 32 kg. But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say that the last two trouts are 32 kg each. But the wording is unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is based on the given data, assuming that the third trout's weight is missing, so the problem can't be solved. But that's unlikely in a problem context. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg, but the way it's written is confusing. For example, maybe ""the last two trouts each weigh 32 kg"". But the problem says ""the last trout he caught weighs 32 kg"". So that's one trout. 

Given that, perhaps the problem has an error. But since this is a problem to solve, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the third trout's weight is missing, but perhaps it's a trick question where the total is calculated with the given three trouts, but the problem says four. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 70 +33 +32 =135 kg, but since there are four trouts, but only three weights given, perhaps the answer is unknown. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say that the third and fourth trouts are both 32 kg. So total weight is 70+33+32+32=167 kg. Then 167 euros. 

But the problem states ""the last trout he caught weighs 32 kg"". So if there are four trouts, the last one is the fourth. Then the third trout's weight is missing. So unless the third trout's weight is zero, which is impossible, the problem is missing data. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake in the number of trouts. If it's three trouts, then total is 70+33+32=135 kg, which would be 135 euros. 

But the problem clearly states four trouts. So this is a contradiction. 

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is 70+33+32=135, but the problem mentions four trouts, which is a mistake. Or perhaps the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg. So total 70+33+32+32=167. 

Since the problem says ""the last trout"" is 32 kg, and there are four trouts, the fourth is 32 kg. The third is missing. So the problem is unsolvable. But since this is a problem presented to solve, perhaps the intended answer is 70+33+32=135, ignoring the count of four trouts. Or perhaps the problem meant that the third and fourth are both 32 kg. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to list all four trouts but missed one. For example, maybe the weights are 70, 33, 32, and another 32. So total 70+33+32+32=167. 

In that case, the answer would be 167 euros. 

Given that, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the last two trouts are 32 kg each. So the answer is 70+33+32+32=167. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say that the third trout is 32 kg, and the fourth is 32 kg, but the wording is off. 

Since the problem is presented as a math problem, and assuming that there's a typo, perhaps the intended total is 70+33+32+32=167. 

Therefore, the answer would be 167 euros. 

Alternatively, if the problem is correct as stated, with four trouts but only three weights given, then it's unsolvable. But since the user is asking for a solution, I think the intended answer is 70+33+32+32=167. 

So I'll proceed with that assumption.

Okay, let's see. Leilani has to submit a 160-page thesis, and she already finished one-fifth of it. The question is how many pages she has left to write. Hmm, right. So first, I need to figure out how many pages she's already written, and then subtract that from the total to find out what's left.

Alright, the total pages are 160. She finished one-fifth. So one-fifth of 160. Let me calculate that. One-fifth is the same as dividing by 5. So 160 divided by 5. Let me do that. 5 times 32 is 160, right? Because 5 times 30 is 150, plus 5 times 2 is 10, so 150+10=160. So 160 divided by 5 is 32. So she's written 32 pages already.

Now, to find out how many pages are left, I subtract the pages she's written from the total. So 160 minus 32. Let me do that subtraction. 160 minus 30 is 130, then minus 2 more is 128. So she has 128 pages left to write.

Wait, let me double-check. If one-fifth is 32, then the remaining would be four-fifths. Let me confirm that. Four-fifths of 160 is (4/5)*160. 160 divided by 5 is 32, times 4 is 128. Yep, same answer. So that makes sense. Both methods give the same result. So the answer should be 128 pages left.
 
 Leilani has completed one-fifth of her 160-page thesis. To find the number of pages she has written:  
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 160 = 32 \text{ pages}
\]  
Subtracting this from the total pages gives the remaining pages:  
\[
160 - 32 = 128 \text{ pages}
\]

78,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Liam has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,54,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many hours Liam spends learning each week. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the problem says there are 6 periods in a day for a normal student, but Liam has to take 1 extra class. So that means Liam has 6 + 1 = 7 classes per day, right? Each class is 60 minutes long, so each day he spends 7 classes * 60 minutes. Let me calculate that: 7 * 60 = 420 minutes per day. 

Then, he goes to class for 6 days a week. So the total minutes from Monday to Friday (assuming those are the 6 days?) would be 420 minutes/day * 6 days. Wait, wait, the problem says ""6 days a week"" which probably includes Saturday, but then the extra learning time is on Saturday and Sunday. Wait, maybe the 6 days are Monday to Saturday? But the problem mentions he has classes for 6 days a week, and then spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday. Hmm, maybe the 6 days are Monday to Saturday, and then Sunday is another day. Wait, but the problem says he goes to class for 6 days a week. So those are his regular classes. Then, on Saturday and Sunday, he spends extra learning time. So the 6 days of classes are separate from the weekend days. Wait, but that would make 8 days a week, which doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the problem says he goes to class for 6 days a week. Then, on Saturday and Sunday (which are part of the 7-day week), he spends extra time. So maybe the 6 days of classes are Monday to Saturday, and Sunday is another day. But the problem says ""each on Saturday and Sunday"" as extra learning time. So the total week is 7 days, with 6 days of classes, and then on Saturday and Sunday (which are two of those days?), but that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the 6 days of classes are from Monday to Saturday, and then on Saturday and Sunday, he does extra learning. Wait, but that would mean Saturday is both a class day and an extra learning day. Hmm, maybe the problem is structured as: he has 6 days of regular classes (maybe Monday to Saturday), and then on Saturday and Sunday, he adds extra learning time. But that would mean Saturday is counted twice. That might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the 6 days of classes are Monday to Friday plus one day on the weekend, but the problem states that he spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The problem says: ""He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time."" So the 6 days of classes are separate from Saturday and Sunday. Wait, but a week only has 7 days. So if he goes to class for 6 days, those are 6 days (maybe Monday to Saturday), and then on Saturday and Sunday, he does extra learning. Wait, that would mean Saturday is both a class day and an extra learning day. But the problem says ""he then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday"". So perhaps the 6 days of classes are Monday to Friday and one weekend day (like Saturday), and then he adds extra time on Saturday and Sunday. But that would mean Saturday has both regular classes and extra time. Alternatively, maybe the 6 days are Monday to Saturday, and the extra time is on Saturday and Sunday. But that would make Saturday a class day and an extra day, which might be possible. Hmm, maybe the problem is structured as follows: he has 6 days of classes (Monday to Saturday), and then on Saturday and Sunday, he adds extra learning time. So Saturday is part of the 6 class days and also part of the extra days. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the 6 days are Monday to Saturday, and the extra time is on Saturday and Sunday. Wait, but the problem says ""he then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday"". Wait, maybe the ""weekly minutes"" refers to the total minutes from his regular classes. Let me check.

Let me try to parse the problem again step by step.

1. Liam has 6 periods a day normally, but takes 1 extra class. So total classes per day: 6 + 1 = 7.

2. Each class is 60 minutes. So daily minutes: 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

3. He goes to class for 6 days a week. So total weekly class time: 6 days * 420 minutes/day = 2520 minutes.

4. Then, he spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Wait, ""each"" here might mean that on Saturday he spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes, and on Sunday another 1/7. So total extra time is 2*(1/7) of his weekly minutes. Wait, but the problem says ""1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday"". So each day (Saturday and Sunday) he spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes. So total extra time is 2*(1/7) = 2/7 of his weekly minutes. But wait, the ""weekly minutes"" here refers to the total from his regular classes (the 2520 minutes), right? Because the problem says ""he then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each..."". So ""weekly minutes"" would be the 2520 minutes from the 6 days of classes. Therefore, each of Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/7 of 2520 minutes. So each day is 2520 / 7 = 360 minutes. Then, two days would be 360 * 2 = 720 minutes.

So total learning time per week is the original 2520 minutes plus 720 minutes extra, totaling 2520 + 720 = 3240 minutes.

Then, convert that to hours by dividing by 60. 3240 / 60 = 54 hours.

Wait, let me check that again. Let's go step by step.

First, calculate regular class time:

7 classes per day (6 normal +1 extra) * 60 minutes = 420 minutes per day.

6 days a week: 6 * 420 = 2520 minutes per week.

Then, the extra time: each Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each day. So ""weekly minutes"" here refers to the total weekly class minutes (2520). So each of those two days, he spends 2520 / 7 = 360 minutes. So two days: 360 * 2 = 720 minutes.

Total time: 2520 + 720 = 3240 minutes.

Convert to hours: 3240 / 60 = 54 hours.

So the answer should be 54 hours.

Wait, but let me confirm that the ""weekly minutes"" refers to the regular class time. The problem says ""he then spends 1/7 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time."" So ""weekly minutes"" could be interpreted as the total minutes he spends in a week, including the extra time. But that would create a circular calculation. Because if the extra time is part of the weekly minutes, then the 1/7 would be part of the total. But that's probably not the case. The problem likely means that the ""weekly minutes"" refers to the original class time (2520), and then he adds 1/7 of that each on Saturday and Sunday. So each day (Saturday and Sunday) he adds 2520 /7 = 360 minutes. So total extra is 720, as before. So total is 2520 + 720 = 3240 minutes = 54 hours.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is 54 hours.
 
 Liam has 7 classes per day (6 normal + 1 extra), each lasting 60 minutes.  
**Daily class time**: \(7 \times 60 = 420\) minutes.  
**Weekly class time (6 days)**: \(6 \times 420 = 2520\) minutes.  

For extra learning on Saturday and Sunday:  
Each day, he spends \(\frac{1}{7}\) of his **weekly class time** (2520 minutes):  
\(\frac{2520}{7} = 360\) minutes per day.  
**Total extra time**: \(2 \times 360 = 720\) minutes.  

**Total weekly learning time**:  
\(2520 + 720 = 3240\) minutes.  
Convert to hours: \(\frac{3240}{60} = 54\) hours.

79,"Elena finished 1/3 of a 315 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 481 piece puzzle within an hour. How many puzzle pieces did Elena place during that hour?",586,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about Elena placing puzzle pieces during an hour. She did two things: she finished 1/3 of a 315-piece puzzle and then started and finished another 481-piece puzzle. The question is how many pieces she placed during that hour.

First, I need to figure out how many pieces she placed from the first puzzle. The first puzzle is 315 pieces, and she finished 1/3 of it. Wait, does ""finished 1/3"" mean that she completed that portion during the hour, or was that her progress before? Hmm, the wording says ""Elena finished 1/3 of a 315 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another..."" So the way it's phrased, during that hour, she both finished the 1/3 of the first puzzle and then did the entire second puzzle. Wait, but maybe she had already done part of the first puzzle before the hour, and during the hour she finished the remaining 1/3? Or does ""finished 1/3"" mean that she completed 1/3 of it during the hour?

The problem is a bit ambiguous here. Let me read it again. ""Elena finished 1/3 of a 315 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 481 piece puzzle within an hour."" So the entire activity of finishing 1/3 of the first puzzle and then doing the entire second puzzle happened within that hour. So during that hour, she placed two parts: the remaining 1/3 of the first puzzle (assuming that she had already done 2/3 before) and the entire 481 pieces of the second puzzle.

Wait, but maybe ""finished 1/3"" means that she completed 1/3 of the puzzle during that hour. So the first puzzle was 315 pieces, and during the hour, she did 1/3 of it. Then she started and finished the second puzzle of 481 pieces. But that would mean she did 1/3 of 315 plus 481. But the problem says she ""started and finished"" the second puzzle within the hour. So the second puzzle was entirely done during the hour. The first part is a bit unclear. If she ""finished 1/3"" of the first puzzle, does that mean she completed that portion during the hour? Or was that her total progress, and perhaps she had done some before?

Wait, the problem says ""Elena finished 1/3 of a 315 piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 481 piece puzzle within an hour."" So the two actions (finishing 1/3 of the first puzzle and doing the entire second puzzle) both happened within the same hour. So the key is to figure out how many pieces she placed from the first puzzle during that hour.

If the first puzzle is 315 pieces, and she finished 1/3 of it during the hour, then that would be 315 * (1/3) = 105 pieces. Then the second puzzle is 481 pieces, which she started and finished, so that's 481 pieces. So total pieces placed during the hour would be 105 + 481 = 586.

But wait, another interpretation: maybe ""finished 1/3"" refers to the portion she completed during the hour. For example, if the puzzle was 315 pieces, and she had already done some part before, and during the hour she finished the remaining 1/3. But the problem doesn't mention anything about prior work. The wording is ""finished 1/3 of a 315 piece puzzle"", which could mean that during the hour, she completed 1/3 of the puzzle. So that's 105 pieces. Then the second puzzle is 481, so total is 105 + 481 = 586.

Alternatively, if ""finished 1/3"" implies that she had already done 2/3 before the hour and during the hour she finished the remaining 1/3, then that would be 315 * (1/3) = 105 pieces. But the problem doesn't state that she had worked on the first puzzle before. The problem says she finished 1/3 of it during the hour. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased such that she worked on the first puzzle and completed 1/3 of it, then moved on to the second puzzle and completed all of it. So the total during the hour would be 1/3 of 315 plus 481.

But that seems a bit odd because if she only completed 1/3 of the first puzzle, then she didn't finish it. But the problem says she ""finished 1/3 of a 315 piece puzzle"". Wait, maybe the phrasing is that she completed 1/3 of the puzzle, meaning she did 1/3 of the total pieces. So 315 * 1/3 = 105 pieces. Then she did another entire puzzle of 481. So total is 105 + 481 = 586.

Alternatively, maybe ""finished 1/3"" means she completed the entire puzzle which was 1/3 of 315 pieces. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The problem says ""a 315 piece puzzle"", so the puzzle has 315 pieces. She finished 1/3 of it. So 1/3 of 315 is 105 pieces. Then the second puzzle is 481, so total is 105 + 481 = 586.

Yes, that seems to be the correct interpretation. So the answer should be 586.
 
 Elena placed a total of **586 puzzle pieces** during the hour. Here's the breakdown:

1. **First Puzzle (315 pieces):**  
   She finished \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the puzzle during the hour.  
   Calculation:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 315 = 105 \text{ pieces}

2. **Second Puzzle (481 pieces):**

80,The vending machines sell cookies for 50 cents and pretzels for 75 cents. Jamal spent $1200 and got 6 bags of cookies and had 7% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?,1484,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many pretzels Jamal bought. Hmm, the problem says he spent $1200 in total, right? But wait, he had 7% of his money left as change. So actually, he didn't spend the entire $1200. Let me start by calculating how much he actually spent.

First, 7% of $1200 is left as change. So the amount he spent would be 100% minus 7%, which is 93% of $1200. Let me compute that. 93% of 1200 is 0.93 * 1200. Let me do that multiplication. 0.93 * 1200. Well, 1200 * 0.9 is 1080, and 1200 * 0.03 is 36. So adding those together, 1080 + 36 = 1116. So he spent $1116.

Now, he bought 6 bags of cookies and some number of pretzels. Each cookie bag is 50 cents, and each pretzel is 75 cents. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says ""bags of cookies"" and ""pretzels""—so maybe each bag of cookies is 50 cents, and each pretzel is 75 cents. So the cost per cookie bag is $0.50, and per pretzel is $0.75.

He bought 6 bags of cookies. So the total cost for cookies is 6 * 0.50 = $3.00. Then the rest of the money he spent must be on pretzels. Let's subtract the cookie cost from the total spent to find out how much was spent on pretzels.

Total spent: $1116. Minus cookies: $3. So 1116 - 3 = 1113. So he spent $1113 on pretzels. Each pretzel is 75 cents, so to find the number of pretzels, we divide the total spent on pretzels by the cost per pretzel.

But wait, $1113 divided by $0.75. Let me compute that. Let's convert $1113 into cents to avoid dealing with decimals. $1113 is 1113 * 100 = 111300 cents. Each pretzel is 75 cents. So 111300 / 75. Let's calculate that.

Dividing 111300 by 75. Let's see, 75 * 1000 is 75,000. 111,300 - 75,000 = 36,300. 75 * 480 is 36,000 (since 75*400=30,000; 75*80=6,000; total 36,000). So 36,300 - 36,000 = 300. 300 /75=4. So total is 1000 + 480 +4= 1484. So he bought 1484 pretzels? Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting dollars to cents. Wait, the total spent on pretzels is $1113. So $1113 is 1113 dollars, which is 1113 * 100 cents = 111300 cents. Correct. Each pretzel is 75 cents. So 111300 divided by 75. Let's compute 75 * 1484. Let's see: 75 * 1000 = 75,000. 75 * 400 = 30,000. 75*80=6,000. 75*4=300. So 75*(1000+400+80+4)=75,000 +30,000 +6,000 +300= 111,300. Yes, that's correct. So 1484 pretzels. That's a huge number, but given that he spent over a thousand dollars on pretzels, maybe that's right. Let me check the steps again.

Total money: $1200. 7% left, so 93% spent: 0.93*1200=1116. Correct. 6 bags of cookies at 50 cents each: 6*0.5=3. So 1116-3=1113 on pretzels. 1113 dollars is 1113*100=111300 cents. Divided by 75 cents per pretzel: 111300 /75=1484. So the answer is 1484 pretzels.

But wait, the problem says ""had 7% of his money left in change"". Wait, 7% of the original $1200, which is 84 dollars. So he spent 1200 - 84 = 1116. Correct. Then the rest of the steps follow. So yes, 1484 pretzels. That seems correct. So the answer is 1484.
 
 Jamal spent 93% of $1200 (since 7% was left as change), totaling $1116. The cost for 6 bags of cookies at $0.50 each is $3. Subtracting this from $1116 leaves $1113 spent on pretzels. Each pretzel costs $0.75, so dividing $1113 by $0.75 gives:

\[
\frac{1113}{0.75} = 1484

81,The Charity fundraiser team hid 180 coins. The Lopez twins each found 43 coins. All the other coins except 17 were found by their friends. How many coins did the friends find?,77,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about the Lopez twins finding coins and their friends finding the rest except some. Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the total number of coins hidden is 180. The Lopez twins each found 43 coins. Wait, ""each"" found 43? So there are two of them, right? The Lopez twins. So each twin found 43 coins. That means together they found 43 times 2. Let me calculate that. 43 multiplied by 2 is 86. So the twins together found 86 coins.

Now, the total coins are 180. So subtracting the twins' coins from the total gives the remaining coins that others found. Wait, but the problem says ""all the other coins except 17 were found by their friends."" Oh, right. So after the twins found their coins, there's 180 minus 86 left. Let me do that: 180 - 86. Let's see, 180 minus 80 is 100, then minus 6 more is 94. So there are 94 coins left after the twins.

But then, out of these 94 coins, all except 17 were found by friends. So that means 17 coins were not found by friends. Wait, but the problem says ""except 17 were found by their friends."" So the friends found the remaining coins minus 17. So the friends found 94 - 17 coins. Let me compute that. 94 minus 10 is 84, minus 7 is 77. So the friends found 77 coins.

Wait, let me check again. Total coins: 180. Twins found 43 each, so 86 total. 180 - 86 = 94. Then, of those 94, 17 were not found by friends. So friends found 94 - 17 = 77. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be 77 coins found by friends.
 
 The Lopez twins each found 43 coins, so together they found \(43 \times 2 = 86\) coins. Subtracting this from the total 180 coins gives \(180 - 86 = 94\) coins remaining. The friends found all except 17 of these remaining coins, so they found \(94 - 17 = 77\) coins.

82,"At the beginning of the conference, there were 63 nurses and 63 engineers. After 45 minutes, 1/2 of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 22 nurses stayed at the conference?",41,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about nurses and engineers at a conference. Initially, there are 63 nurses and 63 engineers. Then after 45 minutes, half of the total number of people left. We need to find out how many engineers are left if 22 nurses stayed. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out the total number of people at the beginning. There are 63 nurses and 63 engineers. So 63 plus 63 is 126 people total. That makes sense.

Then, after 45 minutes, half of them left. Half of 126 is 63. So 63 people left, and the remaining 63 stayed. Wait, but the problem says that 22 nurses stayed. So we need to find out how many engineers stayed, given that total stayed is 63, and 22 of them are nurses.

Wait, let me check again. Total people initially: 63 + 63 = 126. Half left, so 126 / 2 = 63 left. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when they say half of the total number of people left, that would mean 63 people left, and 63 remained. So the remaining people are 63. Out of these 63, 22 are nurses. So the rest must be engineers. So 63 total remaining minus 22 nurses equals 41 engineers. So the answer is 41 engineers left?

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me verify. The problem states that after 45 minutes, 1/2 of the total number of people left. So total people was 126, so half left (63 left), and half stayed (63 stayed). Then, of those 63 who stayed, 22 are nurses. So the remaining 63 - 22 = 41 must be engineers. That seems straightforward.

But wait, is there any possibility that the leaving people could have different numbers of nurses and engineers? Like, maybe the problem is implying that half of each group left? But the problem says ""1/2 of the total number of people left."" So it's half of the total, not half of each group. So the total number leaving is 63, but how many nurses and engineers left could vary. But the problem gives us that 22 nurses stayed. So if 22 nurses stayed, then the number of nurses who left would be original 63 minus 22 = 41 nurses left. Wait, no: original nurses were 63. If 22 stayed, then 63 - 22 = 41 nurses left. Similarly, engineers: original 63. Let E be the number of engineers who stayed. Then total people who stayed are 22 (nurses) + E (engineers) = 63. So E = 63 -22 =41. So engineers left (stayed) are 41. So the answer is 41.

But wait, another way to check: total people left is 63. Nurses stayed 22, so engineers stayed 63-22=41. So yes, that's correct. The problem doesn't specify anything about the distribution of who left, just the total number. So regardless of how the 63 who left were split between nurses and engineers, the ones who stayed must add up to 63. Since 22 nurses stayed, engineers must be 41. So the answer is 41.
 
 At the beginning of the conference, there were 63 nurses and 63 engineers, totaling 126 people. After 45 minutes, half of the total attendees left, which is \( \frac{126}{2} = 63 \) people. This means 63 people remained, consisting of nurses and engineers. Given that 22 nurses stayed, the number of engineers remaining is calculated by subtracting the nurses from the total remaining attendees:  
\[
63 \, (\text{total remaining}) - 22 \, (\text{nurses}) = 41 \, \text{engineers}.

83,"The Jones family is busy making brownies. So far, they've made 7000 brownies. They have 1027 lemon brownies, 2009 strawberry brownies, and some peanut butter brownies. How many peanut butter brownies have they made?",3964,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about the Jones family making brownies. They've made a total of 7000 brownies so far. Out of these, some are lemon, some are strawberry, and the rest are peanut butter. The question is asking how many peanut butter brownies they've made.

First, I need to figure out the numbers given. They have 1027 lemon brownies and 2009 strawberry brownies. The rest are peanut butter. So, the total is the sum of all three types. To find the peanut butter ones, I should subtract the lemon and strawberry from the total.

Let me write that down. Total brownies = lemon + strawberry + peanut butter. So, peanut butter = total - (lemon + strawberry).

Plugging in the numbers: peanut butter = 7000 - (1027 + 2009). Let me compute that step by step. First, add 1027 and 2009. Let's see, 1000 + 2000 is 3000. Then 27 + 9 is 36. So 1027 + 2009 = 3036? Wait, wait, maybe I should check that again. Let me add them properly.

1027
+2009
= ?

Starting from the rightmost digits: 7 + 9 = 16, carry over 1. Then 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. Next, 0 + 0 = 0. Then 1 + 2 = 3. So that's 3036. Yes, that's correct.

So total lemon and strawberry is 3036. Then subtract that from 7000. 7000 - 3036. Let's compute that. 

7000 minus 3000 is 4000. Then subtract 36 more. 4000 - 36 = 3964. So the peanut butter brownies should be 3964.

Wait, let me double-check the subtraction. Maybe another way: 7000 - 3036. Let's break it down. 7000 - 3000 = 4000. Then 4000 - 36. Hmm, 4000 - 30 is 3970, then subtract 6 more is 3964. Yep, that's right.

So the answer should be 3964 peanut butter brownies. Let me just make sure I didn't make any addition or subtraction errors. Let me add 1027 + 2009 again. 1027 + 2000 is 3027, then add 9 more: 3027 +9 = 3036. Correct. Then 7000 - 3036. Let's do it step by step. 7000 - 3000 is 4000. Then subtract 36: 4000 - 36. 4000 minus 30 is 3970, minus 6 is 3964. Yep, that's right. So the answer is 3964.
 
 The Jones family has made a total of 7000 brownies. To find the number of peanut butter brownies, subtract the lemon and strawberry brownies from the total:

**Step 1:** Add the lemon and strawberry brownies:  
1027 (lemon) + 2009 (strawberry) = 3036.

**Step 2:** Subtract this sum from the total brownies:  
7000 (total) − 3036 = **3964**.

84,"Kayla buys 10 shares of a stock for €56 each. The stock price increases 30% the first year Kayla holds it, then decreases 25% in the second year. What is the final value of all Kayla's shares?",546,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Kayla buys 10 shares at €56 each. Then the stock price goes up 30% the first year, and then down 25% the second year. I need to find the final value of all her shares after those two years.

First, let me figure out the initial total cost. She has 10 shares, each at €56. So 10 times 56. Let me calculate that. 56 times 10 is 560 euros. But wait, the question is about the final value, not the profit, so maybe I don't need the initial cost. Hmm, right, the final value is just the number of shares multiplied by the final price per share.

So maybe I should track the price per share each year. Let's start with the initial price per share: €56.

First year: the stock increases by 30%. To calculate the new price after a 30% increase, I can multiply the original price by 1.30. So 56 * 1.3. Let me compute that. 56 times 1.3. 56 * 1 is 56, 56 * 0.3 is 16.8. Adding them together: 56 + 16.8 = 72.8. So after the first year, each share is worth €72.80.

Second year: the stock decreases by 25%. So the new price is 72.8 minus 25% of 72.8. Alternatively, multiply by 0.75 (since 100% -25% =75%). Let's do that. 72.8 * 0.75. Hmm, calculating that. Let's break it down. 72 * 0.75 is 54, and 0.8 * 0.75 is 0.6. So 54 + 0.6 = 54.6. Wait, no. Wait, 72.8 * 0.75. Let me compute it step by step. 70 * 0.75 is 52.5, and 2.8 * 0.75 is 2.1. So 52.5 + 2.1 = 54.6. So after the second year, each share is €54.60.

Now, Kayla has 10 shares. So the total value is 10 * 54.6. That's 546 euros. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me verify the calculations again. First year: 56 * 1.3. 56 * 1.3. 56*1=56, 56*0.3=16.8. Total 72.8. Correct. Then 72.8 * 0.75. Let's compute 72.8 * 0.75. 72.8 * 0.75. 72.8 divided by 4 is 18.2, so three times that is 54.6. Yes, that's right. So each share is 54.6. Multiply by 10: 546. So the final value is €546.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the overall percentage change. First a 30% increase followed by a 25% decrease. The overall multiplier would be 1.3 * 0.75. Let's compute that. 1.3 * 0.75. 1*0.75 is 0.75, 0.3*0.75 is 0.225. Adding them gives 0.975. So the final price is 56 * 0.975. Let's check that. 56 * 0.975. 56 * 1 is 56, 56 * (-0.025) would be subtracting 1.4 (since 56*0.025=1.4). So 56 - 1.4 = 54.6. Yep, same result. Then 54.6 *10=546. So that's correct.

So the answer should be €546.
 
 The final value of Kayla's shares is calculated as follows:

1. **Initial Investment**:  
   Kayla buys 10 shares at €56 each.  
   Total initial value = \(10 \times 56 = €560\).

2. **First Year (30% Increase)**:  
   New price per share = \(56 \times 1.30 = €72.80\).

3. **Second Year (25% Decrease)**:  
   New price per share = \(72.80 \times 0.75 = €54.60\).

4. **Final Value**:  
   Total value after two years = \(10 \times 54.60 = €546\).

**Answer**: €546",True
85,"If Kai and Mateo have 860 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Mateo getting 100 yards more than Kai, how much is left over for Kai?",380,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is that Kai and Mateo have a total of 860 yards of fence, and they want to split it. But Mateo is getting 100 yards more than Kai. I need to find out how much is left for Kai after the split. Wait, no, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me check again. Oh, right, ""how much is left over for Kai?"" Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Because if they split the 860 yards between them, then the total they use would be Kai's share plus Mateo's share, which is Kai's amount plus (Kai's amount + 100). So maybe the question is asking how much Kai gets, not how much is left over. Because if they split all the fence, there's nothing left over. Unless there's some other part I'm missing. Wait, maybe the problem is that they have 860 yards total, and when they split it with Mateo getting 100 more, how much does Kai get? So ""left over"" might be a misstatement, and they just mean how much does Kai get. Let me proceed with that assumption.

Let me set up variables. Let K be the amount Kai gets. Then Mateo gets K + 100. Together, their total is K + (K + 100) = 2K + 100. This total should equal 860 yards. So the equation is 2K + 100 = 860. Solving for K: subtract 100 from both sides, 2K = 760. Then divide by 2, K = 380. So Kai gets 380 yards. Then Mateo gets 480. Together, 380 + 480 = 860, which checks out. So the answer should be 380 yards. But wait, the problem says ""how much is left over for Kai?"" If they are using all the fence, then there's nothing left. But maybe the problem is that they have 860 yards, but when they split it with Mateo getting 100 more than Kai, maybe there's some leftover. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me read the problem again carefully.

""If Kai and Mateo have 860 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Mateo getting 100 yards more than Kai, how much is left over for Kai?""

Wait, ""split it"" implies dividing the total between them. So if they split all 860 yards, then there's nothing left. So the question might be phrased incorrectly. Maybe it's supposed to be ""how much does Kai get?"" But the wording says ""left over"". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they have 860 yards total, but when they split it in such a way that Mateo gets 100 more than Kai, perhaps the sum of their shares is less than 860, leaving some leftover. But that would require a different setup. Let me think again.

If the total they have is 860, and they split some amount where Mateo gets 100 more than Kai, but maybe they don't use all the fence. Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether they are using all the fence or just splitting their existing 860. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's parse it again.

Original problem: ""If Kai and Mateo have 860 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Mateo getting 100 yards more than Kai, how much is left over for Kai?""

So ""split it"" refers to the 860 yards. So they are dividing the 860 yards between them, with Mateo getting 100 more than Kai. So the total split would be K + (K + 100) = 860. Then solving as before, K = 380. So Kai gets 380, Mateo 480. Total 860. Therefore, there's nothing left over. But the question is asking ""how much is left over for Kai?"" That's confusing. Unless ""left over"" is a mistake and they meant ""how much does Kai get?"" Or perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem is that they have 860 yards of fence, and they are splitting it such that Mateo takes 100 yards more than Kai. So the total used is K + (K + 100) = 2K + 100. But if this total is less than 860, then the leftover would be 860 - (2K + 100). But the problem says they ""split it"", which usually means dividing the entire amount. So in that case, there's no leftover. Therefore, the answer would be that Kai gets 380, and there's no leftover. But the question is phrased as ""how much is left over for Kai?"" That doesn't make sense. Unless the problem is that they are using the fence for some project, and after splitting, there's leftover. But the problem doesn't mention that. Maybe it's a translation error or a typo. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that they have 860 yards in total, and when they split, Mateo takes 100 yards more than Kai, but the total split is 860. So the answer is Kai gets 380, and there's nothing left. But the question says ""left over"". Maybe the problem intended to ask ""how much does Kai get?"" but wrote ""left over"". Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe ""left over"" refers to after using some for another purpose. But the problem doesn't mention that. The problem states they have 860 yards between them, agree to split it with Mateo getting 100 more than Kai. So splitting the 860 yards. Therefore, the split would use all 860, so nothing is left. Therefore, the answer is 380 yards for Kai, and 0 left over. But the question is ""how much is left over for Kai?"" So perhaps the answer is 380, interpreting ""left over"" as ""allocated to"". But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in another context where splitting the fence refers to using it for a pen or something, and the leftover is the part not used. But the problem doesn't provide that context. 

Given the problem as stated, the most logical interpretation is that they split the entire 860 yards, with Mateo getting 100 more than Kai. Therefore, Kai's share is 380, and there's nothing left. But since the question asks for ""left over"", perhaps the answer is 380, assuming that ""left over"" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a non-native speaker and ""left over"" is intended to mean ""what's left for Kai after Mateo takes his share"". In that case, the answer would still be 380. 

I think the correct answer is 380 yards. The confusion with ""left over"" might be a translation error or a typo. So proceeding with that.
 
 Let \( K \) be the amount of fence Kai receives. Since Mateo gets 100 yards more than Kai, Mateo receives \( K + 100 \). Together, their total is:

\[
K + (K + 100) = 860
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2K + 100 = 860 \\
2K = 760 \\
K = 380
\]

**Verification:**  
Kai gets 380 yards, Mateo gets \( 380 + 100 = 480 \) yards. Total: \( 380 + 480 = 860 \), which matches the given amount. Since the entire 860 yards is split between them, there is no leftover fence. However, interpreting ""left over for Kai"" as his allocated portion:

**Answer:** 380 yards.",True
86,"Nadia qualified for a spot on the swimming team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for $21, a pair of swimming leggings for $4 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally $32 but were on sale for one-eighth price. She had a coupon for $3 off the package of $9 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?",56,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Nadia bought some athletic gear, and I need to figure out how much she spent in total. Let me break down each item she purchased and calculate their costs step by step.

First, the jersey. The problem says she bought a jersey for $21. That's straightforward. So jersey cost is $21.

Next, the swimming leggings. It says they cost $4 more than the jersey. So the leggings would be the price of the jersey plus $4. Let me calculate that. $21 plus $4 is $25. So the leggings are $25.

Then there's the pair of cleats. The original price was $32, but they were on sale for one-eighth of that. Hmm, one-eighth of $32. Let me do that math. 32 divided by 8 is 4. So the cleats cost $4 on sale. Wait, that seems really cheap. Let me check again. 32 divided by 8 is indeed 4. Yeah, so the sale price is $4.

Next item is the package of athletic headbands, which was $9. But she had a coupon for $3 off. So the headbands would cost $9 minus $3. That's $6. Right, $9 minus $3 is $6.

Now, I need to add up all these amounts to find the total she spent. Let's list them again:

- Jersey: $21
- Leggings: $25
- Cleats: $4
- Headbands: $6

Adding them together. Let's start with 21 + 25. That's 46. Then add 4, which makes 50. Then add 6, which brings the total to 56. So $21 + $25 + $4 + $6 equals $56.

Wait, let me double-check each calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Jersey is definitely $21. Leggings are $4 more, so 21+4=25. Cleats were 32 originally, on sale for 1/8 price: 32/8=4. Headbands were $9 with a $3 coupon: 9-3=6. Adding all together: 21+25=46, 46+4=50, 50+6=56. Yep, that seems right. So the total she spent is $56.
 
 Nadia's total expenditure on athletic gear is calculated by summing the costs of each item:

1. **Jersey**: $21  
2. **Swimming Leggings**: $21 (jersey) + $4 = $25  
3. **Cleats**: Original $32, sale price = $32 ÷ 8 = $4  
4. **Headbands**: $9 – $3 coupon = $6  

**Total Cost**:  
$21 (jersey) + $25 (leggings) + $4 (cleats) + $6 (headbands) = **$56**

87,"The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is 330 meters long, and people slide down at 55 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",3,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about comparing the time it takes to ride two different waterslides. The biggest one is 330 meters long with a speed of 55 meters per minute. The second biggest is 240 meters long but faster at 80 meters per minute. The question is asking how much longer the biggest slide takes compared to the second one. 

Hmm, right. So time is equal to distance divided by speed, right? So for each slide, I need to calculate the time by taking the length divided by the sliding speed. Then subtract the two times to find the difference.

Let me start with the biggest slide. The distance is 330 meters, and the speed is 55 m/min. So time for the biggest slide would be 330 divided by 55. Let me calculate that. 330 divided by 55. Well, 55 times 6 is 330, because 55*5=275, plus 55 is 330. So that's 6 minutes. 

Then the second slide is 240 meters at 80 m/min. So time here is 240 divided by 80. That's 3 minutes, because 80*3=240. 

So the difference between the two times is 6 minutes minus 3 minutes, which equals 3 minutes. Therefore, the biggest slide takes 3 minutes longer than the second biggest. 

Wait, let me double-check. If the first slide is longer but slower, it makes sense that it takes more time. The calculations seem straightforward. 330/55 is indeed 6, and 240/80 is 3. The difference is 3 minutes. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The answer should be 3 minutes longer.
 
 To determine how much longer the biggest waterslide takes compared to the second biggest, calculate the time for each using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):

1. **Biggest Slide**:  
   \( \text{Time}_1 = \frac{330\ \text{meters}}{55\ \text{meters/minute}} = 6\ \text{minutes} \).

2. **Second Biggest Slide**:  
   \( \text{Time}_2 = \frac{240\ \text{meters}}{80\ \text{meters/minute}} = 3\ \text{minutes} \).

88,"Keisha can run eight times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is 3/4 as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in 8 hours if she spends one-half of the time running and 1/2 of the time walking?",18,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. Hmm, first, let's parse all the information given. So Keisha has three modes of movement: running, walking, and skipping. The problem gives us their relative speeds and asks how many miles she can travel in 8 hours if she spends half the time running and half walking. Wait, but the problem mentions skipping speed, but the question is about her traveling by running and walking. Maybe the skipping part is just to relate the speeds?

Let me start by breaking down the given data. The problem states:

1. Keisha can run eight times faster than she can walk.
2. She can skip at 3/4 as fast as she can run.
3. Her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
4. She spends half the time (which is 8 hours total) running and half walking. So that's 4 hours running and 4 hours walking.

The question is: How many miles can she travel in 8 hours under these conditions?

First, I need to find her running and walking speeds. Let's denote her walking speed as W. Then her running speed is 8W. Then, her skipping speed is 3/4 of her running speed. But they tell us that her skipping speed is 3 mph. So, maybe we can set up an equation here.

Skipping speed = (3/4) * running speed. So:

3 mph = (3/4) * running speed.

Therefore, running speed = 3 / (3/4) = 3 * (4/3) = 4 mph. So her running speed is 4 mph. Then, since running speed is 8 times walking speed, walking speed W = running speed / 8 = 4 / 8 = 0.5 mph. Wait, that seems really slow. 0.5 mph walking speed? That's like a very slow walk. But maybe that's correct based on the problem's parameters.

Let me check again. If skipping is 3 mph, which is 3/4 of running speed. So running speed is 4 mph. Then running is 8 times walking, so walking is 4 divided by 8, which is 0.5 mph. Yeah, that's correct. So walking speed is 0.5 mph.

Now, the total time is 8 hours. She spends half the time running and half walking. So 4 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Total distance would be (running speed * time running) + (walking speed * time walking).

So that's (4 mph * 4 hours) + (0.5 mph * 4 hours) = 16 miles + 2 miles = 18 miles.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me go through each part again.

First, skipping speed is given as 3 mph. Skipping speed is 3/4 of running speed. So running speed R is R = 3 / (3/4) = 4 mph. That's correct. Then running speed is 8 times walking speed. So walking speed W = R / 8 = 4 / 8 = 0.5 mph. That's correct.

Time allocation: half of 8 hours is 4 hours each. So 4 hours running at 4 mph: 4*4=16 miles. 4 hours walking at 0.5 mph: 4*0.5=2 miles. Total 18 miles. That seems right.

But wait, the problem mentions she can skip, but the question is about her traveling by running and walking. So the skipping speed was just a way to find her running speed. So the answer is 18 miles. Let me check once more.

Yes, the steps are:

1. Skipping speed = 3 mph = 3/4 * running speed. So running speed is 4 mph.

2. Running speed is 8 * walking speed. So walking speed is 0.5 mph.

3. Time spent: 4 hours running, 4 hours walking.

4. Distance: (4 * 4) + (0.5 * 4) = 16 + 2 = 18.

Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be 18 miles.
 
 Keisha's skipping speed is given as 3 mph, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of her running speed. Let \( R \) be her running speed. Solving \( \frac{3}{4}R = 3 \) mph gives \( R = 4 \) mph. Her running speed is 8 times her walking speed (\( W \)), so \( W = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \) mph.

Over 8 hours, she spends half the time (4 hours) running and half the time (4 hours) walking. The total distance is:
\[
\text{Distance} = (\text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running}) + (\text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking})
\]
\[
= (4 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours}) + (0.5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours}) = 16 \, \text{miles} + 2 \, \text{miles} = 18 \, \text{miles}.

89,Kai hires a luxury car from 1 PM to 5 PM. He gets 2 hours free. The first paid hour is $10 and each hour after that is twice the cost. How much did he pay?,30,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Kai hires a luxury car from 1 PM to 5 PM. So first, I need to figure out how many hours he used the car. Let me calculate the total time first. From 1 PM to 5 PM is 4 hours. Right? Because 5 minus 1 is 4. So he had the car for 4 hours.

Now, the problem says he gets 2 hours free. So out of those 4 hours, the first 2 hours are free. That leaves him with 4 - 2 = 2 hours that he has to pay for.

The payment structure is: the first paid hour is $10, and each hour after that is twice the cost. Wait, so the first paid hour is $10. Then each subsequent hour is double the previous one. Let me parse that again. So the first paid hour is $10. The next hour (if there is one) would be 2 times $10, which is $20. Then the next would be 2 times $20, which is $40, and so on. But in this case, he has 2 paid hours. Wait, but maybe the wording is a bit different. Let me check.

The problem states: ""The first paid hour is $10 and each hour after that is twice the cost."" Hmm. So the first hour he pays for is $10. Then each hour after that first paid hour is twice the cost of the previous one. So the second paid hour would be 2 times $10, which is $20. If there's a third paid hour, it would be 2 times $20, which is $40, etc.

In Kai's case, he has 2 paid hours. So the first paid hour is $10, the second paid hour is $20. So total cost would be $10 + $20 = $30.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The total paid hours are 2. The first paid hour is $10. Then each subsequent paid hour is twice the previous. So the first paid hour is $10, the second is $20. So adding them gives $30. That seems right.

So the answer should be $30. Let me double-check the time. He used the car for 4 hours. First 2 free, so 2 paid hours. The first paid hour is $10, the next is double that, so $20. Total $30. Yep, that makes sense.
 
 Kai rented the car from 1 PM to 5 PM, totaling 4 hours. The first 2 hours are free, leaving 2 paid hours. The cost structure is as follows:

- **First paid hour**: $10  
- **Second paid hour**: Double the previous hour → 2 × $10 = $20  

**Total payment**: $10 + $20 = **$30**

90,"Amelia has three times as many LinkedIn friends as Zahra. Mei has ten times as many friends on LinkedIn as Zahra. If Amelia has 45 friends on LinkedIn, how many LinkedIn friends does Mei have?",150,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Amelia, Zahra, and Mei's LinkedIn friends. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says Amelia has three times as many LinkedIn friends as Zahra. So if Zahra has a certain number of friends, Amelia has three times that. Then Mei has ten times as many as Zahra. And we know Amelia's number is 45. The question is, how many does Mei have?

Alright, let's assign variables to make this easier. Let me call Zahra's number of friends Z. Then Amelia's would be 3Z because she has three times as many. Mei's would be 10Z, ten times Zahra's. 

The problem states that Amelia has 45 friends. So 3Z equals 45. To find Z, I can divide both sides by 3. So Z = 45 / 3. Let me calculate that. 45 divided by 3 is 15. So Zahra has 15 friends. 

Now, Mei has ten times Zahra's, so Mei's friends are 10 times 15. That would be 10 * 15. Let me do that multiplication. 10 times 15 is 150. So Mei has 150 LinkedIn friends. 

Wait, let me double-check. If Zahra has 15, Amelia has 3*15=45, which matches the given info. Then Mei's 10*15=150. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps are straightforward: set up the equations based on the problem, solve for Z using Amelia's known number, then plug into Mei's equation. All checks out.
 
 Amelia has three times as many LinkedIn friends as Zahra, and Mei has ten times as many as Zahra. Let \( Z \) represent Zahra's number of friends.  

1. **Amelia's friends**: \( 3Z = 45 \).

91,"At Kai's house, there are seven times as many apples as bananas. He has a total of 53 bananas in his house. Kai bought 60 more bananas at the store and 36 fewer apples than the number of bananas. Find the combined total of the number of apples and bananas Kai has in the house?",508,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about Kai's apples and bananas. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alright, the first sentence says, ""At Kai's house, there are seven times as many apples as bananas. He has a total of 53 bananas in his house."" Wait, wait. Wait, hold on. The wording here might be a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. ""Seven times as many apples as bananas"" means that the number of apples is 7 times the number of bananas. But then it says he has a total of 53 bananas. So initially, before buying anything, he has 53 bananas. Then, apples would be 7 times that, right?

So initial bananas = 53. Initial apples = 7 * 53. Let me calculate that. 7 times 50 is 350, and 7 times 3 is 21, so 350 +21=371. So initially, he has 371 apples and 53 bananas.

Then, he bought 60 more bananas. So the new number of bananas is 53 +60 = 113 bananas. Got that part.

Now, the next part says he bought ""36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" Wait, this part is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. ""36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" So, does that mean he bought apples equal to (number of bananas he has after buying 60) minus 36? Or is it referring to the original number of bananas? Hmm. The problem says he bought 60 more bananas and 36 fewer apples than the number of bananas. So the structure is: he bought 60 more bananas, and he bought some apples, which are 36 fewer than the number of bananas. Wait, but which bananas? The original 53, or the new total after adding 60?

The problem states: ""Kai bought 60 more bananas at the store and 36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" The way it's phrased, ""the number of bananas"" here probably refers to the current number after buying the 60. Because he first buys the bananas, increasing the count, then buys apples based on that new count. Let me check that logic.

So, first, he had 53 bananas. He buys 60 more, so bananas become 53 +60 =113. Then, he buys apples. The number of apples he buys is 36 fewer than the number of bananas (which is now 113). So apples bought would be 113 -36 =77 apples. Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says ""36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" So if the number of bananas is 113, then apples bought would be 113 -36 =77. But wait, the original apples were 371. So the total apples now would be original apples plus the apples he bought. Wait, but the problem says ""bought 60 more bananas and 36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse the sentence again.

The problem says: ""Kai bought 60 more bananas at the store and 36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" So the structure is: he bought two things: 60 more bananas, and some apples. The apples he bought are 36 fewer than the number of bananas. But which number of bananas? The original or the new?

The problem is ambiguous here. Let's think. If the problem had said ""36 fewer apples than bananas,"" it might mean compared to the bananas he bought. But he bought 60 bananas. So maybe the apples bought are 60 (the number of bananas bought) minus 36? That would be 24 apples. But that's a different interpretation. Alternatively, the problem might mean that the total number of apples he bought is 36 less than the total number of bananas he has after buying the 60. So 113 bananas total, so apples bought would be 113 -36 =77. But that seems like a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the apples he bought are 36 fewer than the number of bananas he bought (which is 60). So 60 -36 =24 apples bought. But the problem says ""the number of bananas,"" not ""the number of bananas bought."" Hmm.

This is a bit confusing. Let's try to see which interpretation makes sense. Let's check both possibilities.

First interpretation: After buying 60 bananas, total bananas are 113. Then, he buys apples equal to 113 -36 =77. So total apples would be original 371 +77 =448. Total fruits would be 448 apples +113 bananas =561.

Second interpretation: He bought 60 bananas and bought apples equal to 60 (the number of bananas bought) minus 36, which is 24 apples. Then total apples would be original 371 +24 =395. Total fruits would be 395 +113 =508.

Third interpretation: Maybe ""the number of bananas"" refers to the original 53. Then apples bought would be 53 -36 =17. Then total apples would be 371 +17=388. Total fruits 388 +113=501.

But the problem says ""the number of bananas"" without specifying, so it's ambiguous. However, in such problems, usually, when you have a sequence of actions, the later actions refer to the current state. So after buying the bananas, the number of bananas is 113, so the apples bought would be 113 -36 =77. That seems more logical. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: ""Kai bought 60 more bananas at the store and 36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" The phrase ""the number of bananas"" here is likely referring to the current number after purchasing the 60 bananas. Because otherwise, if it referred to the original number, the problem would have said ""the original number of bananas"" or something similar. So I think the correct interpretation is that after buying 60 bananas, the total bananas are 113, and he buys 113 -36 =77 apples. Therefore, the total apples would be original 371 plus 77, which is 448. Then total combined apples and bananas would be 448 +113 =561.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says ""36 fewer apples than the number of bananas."" So if the number of bananas is 113, then apples bought are 113 -36 =77. But does that mean he bought 77 apples, or that the total apples he has now are 77? No, because he already had 371 apples. So he bought 77 more apples. So total apples would be 371 +77 =448. Then total fruits would be 448 apples +113 bananas =561.

Alternatively, if the problem meant that the total number of apples after buying is 36 fewer than the total number of bananas, then total apples would be 113 -36 =77. But that would mean he had 77 apples in total, which contradicts the initial 371. So that can't be right. So the correct interpretation must be that he bought 77 apples, adding to the existing 371.

Therefore, the combined total would be 448 +113 =561.

But let me double-check. Let's go step by step.

Original number of bananas: 53.

Original number of apples: 7 times as many as bananas, so 7*53=371.

He buys 60 more bananas: 53 +60=113 bananas now.

He buys apples: the number bought is 36 fewer than the number of bananas (which is 113). So apples bought: 113 -36=77.

Therefore, total apples now: 371 +77=448.

Total combined: 448 +113=561.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is 561.
 
 Kai initially has 53 bananas and 7 times as many apples, which is \(7 \times 53 = 371\) apples. After buying 60 more bananas, the total number of bananas becomes \(53 + 60 = 113\). He then buys apples that are 36 fewer than the updated number of bananas: \(113 - 36 = 77\) apples purchased. Adding these to the original apples, the total apples become \(371 + 77 = 448\). 

**Combined Total**:  
Apples: 448  
Bananas: 113  
Total: \(448 + 113 = 561\)

92,"Jin slew 150 goblins with his mighty sword, while DeShawn, using a spear, slew five-sixths as many goblins as Jin. Using a rusty iron axe, Gabriel slew two times as many goblins as DeShawn. But Oscar, having forgotten his sword at home, slew three-sixths as many goblins as Gabriel using a nail file. How many goblins has Oscar slain?",125,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's try to figure out how many goblins Oscar slew. Hmm, the problem gives information about four people: Jin, DeShawn, Gabriel, and Oscar. Each of them killed a certain number of goblins based on the previous person's count. Let me break it down step by step.

First, Jin slew 150 goblins. That's straightforward. So Jin = 150.

Next, DeShawn used a spear and slew five-sixths as many as Jin. So DeShawn's number is 5/6 of Jin's. Let me calculate that. Five-sixths of 150. Let's see, 150 divided by 6 is 25, then multiplied by 5 would be 125. So DeShawn = 125. Wait, 5/6 * 150. Yeah, 150 divided by 6 is 25, 25*5=125. That makes sense.

Then Gabriel used a rusty axe and slew two times as many as DeShawn. So Gabriel's count is 2 multiplied by DeShawn's 125. Let me compute that. 2 * 125 is 250. So Gabriel = 250. Okay, that's straightforward.

Now, Oscar slew three-sixths as many as Gabriel. Three-sixths simplifies to 1/2, right? So Oscar's number is half of Gabriel's. Gabriel had 250, so half of that is 125. Wait, 250 divided by 2 is 125. So Oscar = 125? Wait, but wait, three-sixths is indeed 1/2. So yes, 250 * (3/6) = 250 * 0.5 = 125. So Oscar slew 125 goblins. Hmm, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again: Jin is 150. DeShawn is 5/6 of that. 5/6 *150: 150 divided by 6 is 25, 25*5=125. Correct. Then Gabriel is twice DeShawn: 125*2=250. Correct. Oscar is three-sixths (which is 0.5) of Gabriel's 250: 250*0.5=125. So yes, Oscar slew 125 goblins. That seems right. But wait, the problem says ""three-sixths as many as Gabriel"". Three-sixths is the same as 1/2, so yeah. So the answer should be 125. Let me just check if I misread any part. The problem says ""Oscar, having forgotten his sword at home, slew three-sixths as many goblins as Gabriel using a nail file."" So three-sixths of Gabriel's number. Gabriel had 250, so 250*(3/6) = 250*(1/2) = 125. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is 125.
 
 Oscar slew **125 goblins**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Jin**: 150 goblins.
2. **DeShawn**: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 150 = 125 \) goblins.
3. **Gabriel**: \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \) goblins.
4. **Oscar**: \( \frac{3}{6} \times 250 = \frac{1}{2} \times 250 = 125 \) goblins.

93,When the water is cold Wei swims a mile in 26 minutes. When the water is warm Wei swims a mile in 5 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Wei take to swim 6 miles on a hot day than a cold day?,186,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about Wei's swimming times depending on the water temperature. I need to find out how much longer it takes him to swim 6 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. Hmm.

First, let's parse the information given. When the water is cold, Wei swims a mile in 26 minutes. So, on a cold day, his time per mile is 26 minutes. Then, when the water is warm (which I assume is the same as a hot day), he takes 5 minutes more than twice as long. Wait, twice as long as what? Oh, right, twice as long as his cold water time. So the warm water time per mile is 5 minutes more than twice the cold time.

Let me write that down. Cold time per mile: 26 minutes. Warm time per mile: 2 * 26 + 5. Let me calculate that. 2*26 is 52, plus 5 is 57. So each mile takes 57 minutes when the water is warm.

Now, the question is about 6 miles. So I need to find the total time difference for 6 miles between a hot day and a cold day.

First, calculate the total time on a cold day. That's 6 miles * 26 minutes per mile. 6*26. Let's see, 25*6 is 150, plus 1*6 is 6, so 156 minutes.

Then, the total time on a hot day. 6 miles * 57 minutes per mile. Let's compute that. 57*6. 50*6 is 300, 7*6 is 42, so 300+42=342 minutes.

Now, the difference between the two is 342 - 156. Let's subtract. 342 - 150 is 192, then subtract 6 more gives 186. So Wei takes 186 minutes longer on a hot day for 6 miles.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Cold time per mile: 26. 6 miles would be 26*6. 26*6: 20*6=120, 6*6=36, 120+36=156. Correct.

Warm time per mile: 2*26=52, plus 5 is 57. Correct. Then 57*6: 50*6=300, 7*6=42, total 342. Correct. Then 342-156: 342-100=242, 242-50=192, 192-6=186. Yes, that's right.

So the answer should be 186 minutes. But let me check if the problem says ""how much longer"" which is the difference, so yes, 186 minutes. That seems correct.
 
 To determine how much longer Wei takes to swim 6 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, follow these steps:

1. **Cold Day Time per Mile**:  
   Wei swims 1 mile in **26 minutes**.

2. **Hot Day Time per Mile**:  
   The time is 5 minutes more than twice the cold day time:  
   \( 2 \times 26 + 5 = 52 + 5 = 57 \) minutes per mile.

3. **Total Time for 6 Miles**:  
   - **Cold Day**:  
     \( 6 \text{ miles} \times 26 \text{ min/mile} = 156 \text{ minutes} \).  
   - **Hot Day**:  
     \( 6 \text{ miles} \times 57 \text{ min/mile} = 342 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Difference in Time**:  
   \( 342 \text{ min} - 156 \text{ min} = 186 \text{ minutes} \).

**Answer**: Wei takes **186 minutes** longer to swim 6 miles on a hot day.",True
94,"1000 people apply for a job at Amazon. Of the people that apply, only 40% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 49% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, two-fourths of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?",98,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about figuring out how many people accepted a position at Amazon after going through the application process. Let me break it down step by step.

First, there are 1000 applicants. Out of these, only 40% get interviews. Hmm, so I need to calculate 40% of 1000. That should be straightforward. 40% is the same as 0.4, so 1000 multiplied by 0.4. Let me do that: 1000 * 0.4 = 400. So 400 people get interviews.

Next, of those 400 interviewees, 49% receive a job offer. Alright, so I need to find 49% of 400. Let's convert 49% to a decimal, which is 0.49. Then multiply that by 400. Let me calculate that: 400 * 0.49. Hmm, 400 times 0.5 would be 200, but since it's 0.49, that's 200 minus 1% of 400. 1% of 400 is 4, so 200 - 4 = 196. So 196 people get job offers.

Then, of those who receive a job offer, two-fourths accept the position. Wait, two-fourths is the same as a half, right? Because 2 divided by 4 is 0.5. So half of the 196 people accept. So 196 divided by 2. Let me check that: 196 / 2 = 98. So 98 people accept the position.

Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with 1000 applicants. 40% interviewed: 1000 * 0.4 = 400. Correct. Then 49% of 400 get offers. 0.49 * 400. Let me verify that calculation again. 400 * 0.49. Breaking it down: 400 * 0.4 = 160, and 400 * 0.09 = 36. Adding those together: 160 + 36 = 196. Yep, that's right. Then two-fourths (which is 1/2) of 196 accept. 196 / 2 is indeed 98. 

So each step checks out. I think that's the correct answer. 98 people accepted the position.
 
 To determine how many people accepted the position, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of interviews**:  
   40% of 1,000 applicants receive interviews.  
   \( 1{,}000 \times 0.40 = 400 \) people interviewed.

2. **Determine job offers**:  
   49% of interviewees receive offers.  
   \( 400 \times 0.49 = 196 \) offers.

3. **Find acceptances**:  
   Two-fourths (equivalent to half) of those offered accept.  
   \( 196 \times \frac{2}{4} = 196 \times \frac{1}{2} = 98 \).

**Final Answer**:

95,"There are 15 students playing football and two times that number playing badminton. There are 19 boys and 28 girls playing table tennis. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?",92,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. I need to find out the total number of students participating in these sports, right? Each student is only in one group, so there's no overlap. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem says there are 15 students playing football. Then, the number playing badminton is two times that number. So, badminton players would be 15 multiplied by 2. Let me calculate that. 15 times 2 is 30. So, badminton has 30 students.

Next, there's table tennis. The problem states there are 19 boys and 28 girls playing table tennis. Wait, so for table tennis, I just need to add the boys and girls together. That would be 19 plus 28. Let me add those numbers. 19 plus 20 is 39, and then plus 8 more is 47. So, table tennis has 47 students.

Now, to find the total number of students, I need to add up the students from all three sports: football, badminton, and table tennis. So that's 15 (football) plus 30 (badminton) plus 47 (table tennis). Let me add them step by step. 15 plus 30 is 45. Then, 45 plus 47. Hmm, 45 plus 40 is 85, and then plus 7 is 92. So the total should be 92 students.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Football: 15. Badminton is two times football, so 30. Table tennis: 19 boys +28 girls =47. Adding all together: 15+30=45, 45+47=92. Yeah, that seems right. Each student is in only one group, so no overlaps to worry about. So the total number of students is 92.
 
 To determine the total number of students participating in the sports, we calculate each group separately and sum them up:

1. **Football**: 15 students.  
2. **Badminton**: Twice the number of football players:  
   \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) students.  
3. **Table Tennis**: 19 boys + 28 girls = \( 19 + 28 = 47 \) students.  

**Total students** = Football + Badminton + Table Tennis

96,"Mia's aunt said that she had ₺300 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have ₺5 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster seven times. A round of laser tag is ₺10. The roller coaster cost ₺5 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",5,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. Mia's aunt has a budget of ₺300 for her birthday party. Mia wants to invite friends, and they all need to do three things: play one round of laser tag, have ₺5 in pinball tokens each, and ride the roller coaster seven times each. I need to figure out how many friends she can invite without exceeding the budget.

First, let's break down the costs per person. Let's start with Mia herself. Wait, does the problem include Mia in the count? Because when they say ""she and her friends,"" that means Mia plus her friends. So the total number of people is 1 (Mia) plus the number of friends she invites. Let's call the number of friends F. So total people are F + 1.

Now, each person (including Mia) has three expenses:

1. Laser tag: ₺10 per person.
2. Pinball tokens: ₺5 per person.
3. Roller coaster rides: 7 times per person at ₺5 each.

Let me calculate each cost per person first.

Laser tag is straightforward: 10 TL each. So per person, that's 10.

Pinball tokens are 5 TL each. So that's another 5 per person.

Roller coaster: 7 rides per person, each ride is 5 TL. So 7 * 5 = 35 TL per person for the roller coaster.

Adding those up per person: 10 + 5 + 35 = 50 TL per person.

So each person (Mia plus each friend) costs 50 TL. Now, the total cost is 50 multiplied by the number of people (F + 1). The total budget is 300 TL. So the equation would be:

50 * (F + 1) ≤ 300

Let me solve for F.

First, divide both sides by 50:

F + 1 ≤ 300 / 50
F + 1 ≤ 6

Subtract 1 from both sides:

F ≤ 5

So Mia can invite up to 5 friends. Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Per person cost breakdown:

Laser tag: 10 TL
Pinball: 5 TL
Roller coaster: 7 * 5 = 35 TL
Total per person: 10 + 5 + 35 = 50 TL. That's correct.

Total people: F friends + Mia = F + 1.

Total cost: 50 * (F + 1) ≤ 300.

Solving:

50(F + 1) = 300 → F +1 = 6 → F =5.

Yes, that seems right. So the maximum number of friends is 5. Let me check if there's any other cost involved that I might have missed. The problem mentions the aunt's budget is for the party, and all the mentioned activities. So I think that's all. So the answer is 5 friends.
 
 Mia's aunt has a budget of ₺300. To determine how many friends Mia can invite, calculate the total cost per person (including Mia) and divide the budget by this amount.

**Cost breakdown per person:**
- **Laser tag:** ₺10
- **Pinball tokens:** ₺5
- **Roller coaster (7 rides × ₺5):** ₺35  
**Total per person:** ₺10 + ₺5 + ₺35 = ₺50

Let \( F \) represent the number of friends. Including Mia, the total number of people is \( F + 1 \). The total cost equation is:  
\[
50 \times (F + 1) \leq 300
\]

**Solving for \( F \):**  
\[
F + 1 \leq \frac{300}{50} \implies F + 1 \leq 6 \implies F \leq 5
\]

**Answer:** Mia can invite **5 friends**.",True
97,"Nia operates the cash register exactly three times as fast as her less-experienced colleague Sakura. Daily, Sakura processes 55 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?",1540,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Nia and Sakura working at a cash register. Nia is three times as fast as Sakura. Sakura processes 55 customers daily. We need to find the total weekly production for both when they work all days of the week.

First, I need to figure out how many customers each of them processes in a day and then multiply by seven days for the week. 

Sakura's daily customers are given as 55. Since Nia is three times as fast, her processing rate should be three times Sakura's. So, Nia would process 55 * 3 = 165 customers per day. Wait, but does ""three times as fast"" mean she does three times as many customers in the same time? I think that's right. If Sakura does 55 in a day, then Nia does three times that, so 165 per day.

Then, the total daily production for both would be Sakura's 55 plus Nia's 165. That's 55 + 165 = 220 customers per day together. 

Now, since they work all days of the week, that's seven days. So the weekly total would be 220 customers/day * 7 days = 1540 customers per week. 

Wait, let me double-check. If Sakura does 55 each day, then weekly she does 55*7. Similarly, Nia does 165*7. So total weekly is (55 + 165)*7. Which is the same as 220*7. Let me compute that again. 220*7: 200*7 is 1400, and 20*7 is 140, so 1400+140=1540. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be 1540.
 
 Nia works three times as fast as Sakura. If Sakura processes 55 customers daily, Nia processes \(55 \times 3 = 165\) customers per day. Together, their daily total is \(55 + 165 = 220\) customers. Over a 7-day week, their combined production is \(220 \times 7 = 1,540\).

98,"A new virus infects 16 people. Every day, each infected person infects 3 others. How many people are infected after 3 days?",1024,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. So the problem is about a virus spreading. Initially, 16 people are infected. Each day, every infected person infects 3 others. We need to find out how many people are infected after 3 days. Hmm, right.

Wait, so first, on day 0, there are 16 people. Then each day, each of those people infects 3 new ones. But wait, does that mean that each day the number of infected people triples? Or is it that each person infects 3 others each day, so the growth is multiplied by 4 each day? Wait, maybe I need to clarify that.

Let me think. If each infected person infects 3 others every day, then each day the number of new infections per person is 3. But does that mean that the total number of infected people is multiplied by 4 each day (original plus 3 new)? Because if each person infects 3 others, then each person is responsible for 3 new infections each day. So, for example, on day 1, each of the 16 would infect 3, so 16*3=48 new people. Then the total would be 16 + 48 = 64. Then on day 2, those 64 each infect 3, so 64*3=192 new, total 64+192=256. Then day 3, 256*3=768 new, total 256+768=1024. So after 3 days, total is 1024. Wait, but that's assuming that the existing people stay infected and keep infecting each day. But maybe the problem is considering that each day, the number of infected people triples. Like, exponential growth. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is modeled such that each infected person infects 3 others each day, and those new infections happen once per day. So the formula would be that each day, the number of new infections is 3 times the current number, and those are added to the total. So the total infected after n days would be initial * (1 + 3)^n. Because each day, the number of people is multiplied by 4 (since each existing person infects 3 new, so total becomes original + 3*original = 4*original). So for 3 days, it's 16 * 4^3. Let's compute that. 4^3 is 64, 16*64 is 1024. So that's the same as before. So the answer would be 1024.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's break it down day by day.

Day 0: 16 people.

Day 1: Each of the 16 infects 3. So new infections are 16*3 = 48. Total infected after day 1: 16 + 48 = 64.

Day 2: Each of the 64 infects 3. New infections: 64*3 = 192. Total: 64 + 192 = 256.

Day 3: Each of the 256 infects 3. New infections: 256*3 = 768. Total: 256 + 768 = 1024.

Yes, that's the same as 16 * 4^3. Because each day, the number is multiplied by 4. So 16 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 16*64=1024.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that once a person is infected, they stay infected and continue to infect 3 new each day. So the total infected each day is cumulative. So the answer is 1024.

But let me check if there's another way. Suppose that each person infects 3 others per day, but those newly infected start infecting the next day. Wait, but the problem says ""every day, each infected person infects 3 others"". So if someone is infected on day 1, do they start infecting on day 1 as well, or do they start on day 2?

Hmm, that's a crucial point. If the new people start infecting the same day they are infected, then the growth is exponential each day. But if they can only start infecting the next day, then it's different.

Wait, the problem states: ""Every day, each infected person infects 3 others."" So perhaps each day, all currently infected people (including those infected that same day) infect 3 others. But that might not make sense. Let me think again.

Suppose on day 1, the original 16 infect 3 each, so 48 new. Then total is 16 + 48 = 64. Now, on day 2, all 64 people infect 3 each, leading to 192 new, total 64 + 192 = 256. Then day 3, 256 infect 3 each, 768 new, total 1024. So yes, same as before.

But if the new people can't infect on the same day they were infected, then the calculation would be different. For example:

Day 0: 16.

Day 1: 16 infect 3 each, so 48 new. Total 16 + 48 = 64. But those 48 can't infect until day 2.

Day 2: The original 16 infect 3 each again (48), and the 48 new from day 1 also infect 3 each (144). So total new on day 2: 48 + 144 = 192. Total infected: 64 + 192 = 256.

Wait, but that's the same as before. Wait, no. Wait, if the 16 original infect 3 each every day, then each day, all existing infected people infect 3 each. So in that case, the total number of infected people each day is multiplied by 4. Because each existing person infects 3 new, so total becomes original + 3*original = 4*original. So each day, it's 4 times the previous day's total.

So in that case, after 3 days, it's 16 * 4^3 = 1024.

But maybe the problem is considering that once a person is infected, they only infect 3 others once, not every day. But the problem says ""every day, each infected person infects 3 others."" So that implies that each day, every infected person (including those infected on previous days) infects 3 new people. So the growth is exponential, compounding daily.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 16 * (3 + 1)^3 = 16 * 64 = 1024.

Alternatively, using the day-by-day approach:

Day 0: 16

Day 1: 16 + (16*3) = 16*4 = 64

Day 2: 64*4 = 256

Day 3: 256*4 = 1024

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 1024.
 
 After analyzing the problem step by step:

**Day 0 (Initial):**  
16 people are infected.

**Day 1:**  
Each of the 16 infected people spreads the virus to 3 others.  
New infections: \(16 \times 3 = 48\).  
Total infected: \(16 + 48 = 64\).

**Day 2:**  
Now 64 people are infected. Each infects 3 others.  
New infections: \(64 \times 3 = 192\).  
Total infected: \(64 + 192 = 256\).

**Day 3:**  
256 infected people each infect 3 others.  
New infections: \(256 \times 3 = 768\).  
Total infected: \(256 + 768 = 1024\).

**Final Answer:**  
After 3 days, \(\boxed{1024}\) people are infected.",True
99,"If Nia eats 5 eggs a day for 84 days and then increases it to 7 eggs a day for 24 days, how many dozens of eggs will Nia need for 108 days?",49,deepseek/deepseek-r1,Together,"
Okay, let's see. The problem is about Nia eating eggs over 108 days and figuring out how many dozens she needs. Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says she eats 5 eggs a day for 84 days. Then she increases to 7 eggs a day for the next 24 days. But wait, 84 plus 24 is 108 days total. So the total time is covered by those two periods. Got it.

So the first part is calculating the total eggs consumed in the first 84 days. That should be 5 eggs/day multiplied by 84 days. Let me compute that. 5 times 80 is 400, and 5 times 4 is 20, so 400 + 20 = 420 eggs. Right, 420 eggs for the first period.

Then the next part is 24 days at 7 eggs per day. Let's calculate that. 7 times 20 is 140, and 7 times 4 is 28. So 140 + 28 = 168 eggs. So 168 eggs for the second period.

Adding those two together gives the total number of eggs needed. 420 + 168. Let's add them: 400 + 160 is 560, and 20 + 8 is 28. So 560 +28 = 588 eggs total.

But the question asks for how many dozens of eggs she needs. Since a dozen is 12 eggs, we need to divide the total eggs by 12. So 588 divided by 12. Let me do that division. 

12 times 40 is 480. 588 minus 480 is 108. Then 12 times 9 is 108. So 40 +9 =49. So 588 divided by 12 is 49. Therefore, she needs 49 dozen eggs.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First part: 5 eggs/day *84 days. 5*80=400, 5*4=20. 400+20=420. Correct.

Second part:7*24. Let's compute 7*20=140, 7*4=28. 140+28=168. Correct.

Total eggs:420+168=588. Yes. Then 588 divided by 12. Let's see: 12*49=588. Because 12*50=600, subtract 12 gives 588. So yes, 49 dozen. That seems right.
 
 Nia's egg consumption is divided into two periods:

1. **First 84 days:**  
   5 eggs/day × 84 days = 420 eggs  
   Calculation: \(5 \times 84 = 420\)

2. **Next 24 days:**  
   7 eggs/day × 24 days = 168 eggs  
   Calculation: \(7 \times 24 = 168\)

**Total eggs consumed:**  
\(420 + 168 = 588\) eggs  

**Convert to dozens (1 dozen = 12 eggs):**  
\(588 \div 12 = 49\)  

**Answer:** Nia will need **49 dozen eggs** for 108 days.",True
