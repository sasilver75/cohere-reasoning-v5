command-r7b-12-2024,Cohere,1,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,3,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of blue fiber needed:**
   - The robe takes **2 bolts of blue fiber**.

2. **Determine the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - The robe takes **half that much white fiber** as blue fiber.
   - Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, half of that is:
     \[
     \frac{","To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of blue fiber needed:**
   - The robe takes **3 bolts of blue fiber**.

2. **Determine the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - The robe takes **half that much white fiber** as blue fiber.
   - Since the robe takes 3 bolts of blue fiber, half of that is:
     \[
     \frac{","3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ bolts of white fiber}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of bolts needed:**
   - Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber:
     \[
     3 \text{ (blue fiber)} + 1.5 \text{ (white fiber)} = 4.5 \text{ bolts in total}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 4.5.<|END_RESPONSE|>",False
