      "First, let me break down the numbers. The ducks lay 16 eggs each day. That's the starting point. Then Janet uses some of them. She eats six for breakfast every morning. So XXXXX  three eggs for breakfast each day. Wait, the problem says three for breakfast every morning. So that's 3 eggs per day. Then she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So that's another 4 eggs used daily for muffins. \n",

      "So total eggs used per day would be 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. Then the remainder is sold. So subtract the used eggs from the total laid. 16 total eggs minus 7 used equals 9 eggs left to sell. Then she sells those 9 eggs at $2 per egg. So 9 eggs times $2 per egg would be 9 * 2 = $18. So she makes $18 each day.\n",

      "Eggs remaining: 16 - 7 = 9.\n",

      "Yes, that's correct. Then selling 9 eggs at $2 each: 9 * 2 = $18. So the answer should be $18. Hmm, seems straightforward. But let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"every day\" for all actions, so the numbers are consistent each day. So yes, the calculation holds. So the answer is $18.\n",
