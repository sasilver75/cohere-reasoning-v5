The total amount paid by the three friends is the sum of the amounts paid by Mike, Jack, and Tom, which is M + J + T = M + (M + 3) + (M + 8) = 3M + 11.

- Eve: Fish","Since Dave ordered soup and sat at one end, and Alice is between Bob and Carol, Alice must be next to Dave. So Alice ordered steak and Let's continue to reason through the problem step by step:

1. **Dave ordered soup and sat at one end.**
   - Let's assume Dave is at the left end.

2. **Alice sat between Bob and Carol.**
   - Since Dave is at the left end, Alice must be at the second position.
   - Therefore, the seating arrangement from left to right is: Dave, Alice, Bob, Carol, Eve.

3. **The person who ordered steak sat next to the person who ordered salad.**
   - Alice ordered steak (since she is next to Dave, who ordered soup).
   - Therefore, the person next to Alice (Bob) must have ordered salad.

4. **Eve sat next to the person who ordered pasta.**
   - Eve is at the right end, so the person next to her (Carol) must have ordered pasta.

5. **Bob didn't order fish.**
   - Bob ordered salad (as deduced above).

6. **Carol ordered pasta (as deduced above).**

7. **Eve must have ordered fish (since she is at the right end and the only dish left is fish).**

So, the final seating arrangement and orders are:
- **Dave**: Soup
- **Alice**: Steak
- **Bob**: Salad
- **Carol**: Pasta
- **Eve**: Fish

- Dave: Soup
- Alice: Steak

1. Combined speed = 60 + 75 = 135 mph
2. In first 30 minutes, Train A travels: 60 mph × 0.5 hours = 30 miles
3. Remaining distance = 300 - 30 = 270 miles
4. Time to cover remaining distance = 270 ÷ 135 = 2 hours
5. Total time from Train B's departure = 2 hours
6. Train B departed at 2:30 PM + 2 hours = 4:30 PM
Therefore, the trains meet at 4:30 PM","The trains are traveling at a combined speed of 60 + 75 = 135 mph.

1. **Calculate the combined speed of the trains:**
   - Train A's speed: 60 mph
   - Train B's speed: 75 mph
   - Combined speed: \( 60 + 75 = 135 \) mph

2. **Determine the time it takes for the trains to meet:**
   - Distance between the stations: 300 miles
   - Time to meet = Distance / Combined speed
   - Time to meet = \( \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{135 \text{ mph}} \)

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{300}{135} \approx 2.222 \) hours

4. **Convert the time from hours to hours and minutes:**
   - 2.222 hours can be broken down into 2 hours and 0.222 hours
   - 0.222 hours * 60 minutes/hour ≈ 13.33 minutes

So, the trains will meet approximately 2 hours and 13.33 minutes after the second train (Train B) starts its journey at 2:30 PM.

5. **Calculate the exact meeting time:**
   - Train B starts at 2:30 PM
   - Add 2 hours and 13.33 minutes to 2:30 PM

1. Let r, b, g be the number of red, blue, green widgets
2. Equation 1: r + b + g = 1200 (total widgets)
3. Equation 2: 2r + 3b + 4g = 3000 (total hours)
4. From Equation 1: r = 1200 - b - g
5. Substitute into Equation 2:
   2(1200 - b - g) + 3b + 4g = 3000
   2400 - 2b - 2g + 3b + 4g = 3000

b + 2g = 600

r + 600 - g = 1200

r - g = 600

   - Notebook 12 gets better discount (40%)
2. Calculate prices:
   - Regular price ($4): 1,2,5,7,10,11 (6 notebooks) = $24
   - 25% off ($3): 3,6,9 (3 notebooks) = $9
   - 40% off ($2.40): 4,8,12 (3 notebooks) = $7.20
Therefore, total spent = $24 + $9 + $7.20 = $40.20","Let's calculate:
1. First, identify which notebooks get discounts:
   - Every 3rd: 3,6,9,12
   - Every 4th: 4,8,12
2. Notebook 12 gets both discounts, so it's 65% off
3. Now let's count regular price ones:","Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. **Identify the notebooks that get discounts:**
   - Every 3rd notebook: 3, 6, 9, 12
   - Every 4th notebook: 4, 8, 12

2. **Notebook 12 gets both discounts, so it's 65% off (25% + 40%).**

3. **Calculate the cost for each type of notebook:**
   - Regular price notebooks: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 11 (6 notebooks)
   - 25% off notebooks: 3, 6, 9 (3 notebooks)
   - 40% off notebooks: 4, 8 (2 notebooks)
   - 65% off notebook: 12 (1 notebook)

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Regular price notebooks: 6 notebooks * $4 = $24
   - 25% off notebooks: 3 notebooks * $4 * 0.75 = $9
   - 40% off notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 * 0.60 = $4.80
   - 65% off notebook: 1 notebook * $4 * 0.35 = $1.40

5. **Sum up all the costs:**
   - Total cost = $24 + $9 + $4.80 + $1.40 = $39.20

deepseek/deepseek-chat,Hyperbolic,28,"A square piece of paper is folded in half vertically, then in half horizontally, creating four equal rectangles. If the perimeter of one small rectangle is 30 inches, what was the perimeter of the original square?","Let me solve this step by step:
1. Each small rectangle is 1/4 of the original square
2. If small rectangle perimeter = 30 inches:
   2l + 2w = 30
   l + w = 15
3. Since it came from folding a square in half twice:
   Original square side = 2w = 2l
   Therefore w = l = 7.5 inches
4. Original square perimeter = 4 × 15 = 60
Therefore, the original square's perimeter was 60 inches","Let's solve this:
1. After folding, we have four equal rectangles
2. If one rectangle's perimeter is 30 inches, let's find its dimensions
3. The rectangle's length must be twice its width
4. So if perimeter is 30, then length + width + length + width = 30","5. Since length is twice width, we can say length = 2 * width
6. So 2 * width + width + 2 * width + width = 30
7. This simplifies to 6 * width = 30
8. So width = 30 / 6 = 5 inches
9. And length = 2 * width = 2 * 5 = 10 inches
10. The original square's side length was the same as the rectangle's length, which is 10 inches
11. So the perimeter of the original square is 4 * side length = 4 * 10 = 40 inches

So the answer is $\boxed{40}$.","Let's solve this:

8. So width = 30 / 6 = 5 inches
9. And length = 2 * width = 2 * 5 = 10 inches
10. The original square's side length was the same as the rectangle's length, which is 10 inches

1. First to second gear ratio: 12:36 = 1:3
   - When first gear makes 60 rotations
   - Second gear makes 60 × (12/36) = 20 rotations
2. Second to third gear ratio: 36:24 = 3:2

   - Third gear makes 20 × (36/24) = 30 rotations
Therefore, the third gear makes 30 complete rotations","Let's solve this:
1. When gears mesh, their rotations are inversely proportional to their teeth
2. From first to second gear: 12/36 = 1/3, so second gear makes 20 rotations
