Okay, picking back up from where we left off...
Added readme, made some small QOL changes...


Concerns:
1. I'm seeing some cases in teh generate_incorrect_solutions_off_policy where we end up not being able
to generate an incorrect solution for one of the row_ids identified as interesting. For these, we just use a placeholder
of "<Placeholder Solution>" and "<Placeholder Reasoning>". I'm not sure if this is a problem or not.
    - What should happen to these when we then go to complete them?
    - Should our generate_completions somehow be robust to this, or something? Should we just discount these ones?
    - Can this happen in teh generate incorrect_solutions_on_policy script too? Checking...
        - For this one, we re-use the same "incorrect solution" that we're padding-out from.
    - I think this might be okay, but we should be careful. 
    - TODO: COME BACK TO THIS
2. 


Running a cohere test through end to end to make sure it all works.
Looks like it did!
I pimped out the view_completions script to allow for jumping to a specific row_id, displaying initial statistics, etc.

Now let's pick another model to try and evaluate!

Maybe let's look at...

- L3 405B
- L3.3 70B?
