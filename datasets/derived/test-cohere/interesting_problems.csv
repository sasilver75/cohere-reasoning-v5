44424,"If the function $f(x) = a\sin x + \cos x$ is monotonically increasing in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, then the range of the real number $a$ is \_\_\_\_\_\_.","To solve this, we find the derivative of the function $f'(x) = a\cos x - \sin x$.

Since the function $f(x) = a\sin x + \cos x$ is monotonically increasing in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$,

it follows that $f'(x) \geq 0$ holds true in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$,

which means $f'(x) = a\cos x - \sin x \geq 0$,

or equivalently, $a\cos x \geq \sin x$,

which can be rewritten as $a \geq \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \tan x$.

Given $x \in \left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$,

we have $\tan \frac{\pi}{6} < \tan x < \tan \frac{\pi}{4}$,

which implies $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} < \tan x < 1$.

Therefore, $a \geq 1$,

Hence, the answer is: $\boxed{[1, +\infty)}$.

To solve this problem, we calculate the derivative of the function and use the relationship between the monotonicity of a function and its derivative to establish that $f'(x) \geq 0$ always holds. This problem primarily tests the application of function monotonicity, and using the derivative is key to solving it.",0,"We know that the function $f(x) = a\sin x + \cos x$ is monotonically increasing in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$. This means that for any $x_1, x_2$ in this interval, if $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$.

Let's start by finding the critical points of the function in this interval. The critical points are the points where the derivative of the function is zero or undefined.

The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:

$$
 \begin{align*}
f'(x) & = a\cos x - \sin x \, .
 \end{align*}
$$

Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we get:

$$
 \begin{align*}
a\cos x - \sin x & = 0 \\
a\cos x & = \sin x \\
a & = \tan x \, .
 \end{align*}
$$

So, the critical points occur when $a = \tan x$. In the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $\tan x$ is positive and increasing. This means that as $x$ increases from $\frac{\pi}{6}$ to $\frac{\pi}{4}$, $a$ also increases.

Now, let's find the values of $a$ at the endpoints of the interval:

- At $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$, $a = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \sqrt{3}$.
- At $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$, $a = \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = 1$.

So, the range of $a$ for which the function is monotonically increasing in the given interval is $\boxed{(1, \sqrt{3})}$.","The final answer provided by the ground truth solution is $\boxed{[1, +\infty)}$.

The candidate solution provides the answer $\boxed{(1, \sqrt{3})}$.

The candidate solution is incorrect. The mistake lies in the interpretation of the monotonicity condition. The solution correctly finds the critical points and determines that $a = \tan x$ for these points. However, it then incorrectly assumes that the function is monotonically increasing for all values of $a$ between the values at the endpoints of the interval. This is not necessarily true, as the function could have other critical points or changes in monotonicity within the interval.

The correct approach, as shown in the ground truth solution, is to consider the derivative $f'(x) = a\cos x - \sin x$ and ensure that it is non-negative for all $x$ in the given interval. This leads to the inequality $a \geq \tan x$, which, when combined with the range of $\tan x$ in the interval, gives the correct range for $a$.",False

So, we differentiate $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:

$$f'(x) = a\cos x - \sin x.$$

For $f(x)$ to be monotonically increasing in the given interval, $f'(x)$ must be positive in $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$. Let's find the critical points of $f'(x)$ in this interval:

$$f'(x) = 0 \implies a\cos x - \sin x = 0 \implies a = \tan x.$$

The critical points occur when $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$. Now, we check the sign of $f'(x)$ in the given interval:

- For $x \in \left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, $\tan x$ is positive and increasing.

So, $f'(x)$ is positive in the given interval when $a$ is in the range:

$$\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) < a < \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) \implies \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} < a < 1.$$

The candidate solution is incorrect. The mistake lies in the interpretation of the critical points and the subsequent sign analysis of $f'(x)$. The critical points $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ are not within the given interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$. Therefore, the sign of $f'(x)$ in this interval is solely determined by the monotonicity of $\tan x$, which is positive and increasing in the given interval.

\[
\frac{1}{2}ab = 4 \implies ab = 8 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Since $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\angle C = 90^{\circ}$, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad \text{(3)}

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3) and using equation (2), we get:

\[
c^2 = (\sqrt{2}c)^2 - 2ab = 2c^2 - 16 \implies c^2 = 16 \implies c = \pm 4

Since $c$ represents a length, we discard $c = -4$ and keep $c = 4$. Substituting $c = 4$ into equation (1), we find:

\[
a+b = \sqrt{2} \cdot 4 = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$, which is $a+b+c$, is:

\[
a+b+c = 4\sqrt{2} + 4

Hence, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{4\sqrt{2} + 4}$.",0,"We are given that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of a right triangle, with $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ by the Pythagorean theorem. We also know that the area of the triangle is $4$, so we can write:

Solving for $b$, we get:

$$b = \frac{8}{a}$$

We are also given that the point $P(1, \sqrt{2})$ lies on the graph of the Pythagorean reciprocal function:

$$y = \frac{a + b}{cx}$$

Plugging in the coordinates of $P$, we get:

$$\sqrt{2} = \frac{a + \frac{8}{a}}{c}$$

Multiplying by $c$ and simplifying, we get:

$$c\sqrt{2} = a + \frac{8}{a}$$

Now, we can square both sides to get rid of the square root:

$$2c^2 = a^2 + 16 + \frac{64}{a^2}$$

Multiplying by $a^2$ and rearranging, we get:

$$a^4 - 2c^2a^2 + 64 = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation in $a^2$, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:

$$a^2 = \frac{2c^2 \pm \sqrt{4c^4 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 64}}{2}$$

Simplifying, we get two possible values for $a^2$:

$$a^2 = c^2 \pm 8$$

Since $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, we can write:

$$c^2 + b^2 = c^2 \pm 8$$

This gives us two possible values for $b^2$:

$$b^2 = 8 \text{ or } b^2 = -8$$

Since $b$ represents a length, we reject the negative value, so $b^2 = 8$, and $b = 2\sqrt{2}$.

Now, we can find $a$ by substituting $b$ back into the area equation:

$$\frac{1}{2}a \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 4$$

Solving for $a$, we get $a = 2\sqrt{2}$.

Finally, we can find $c$ using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$c = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\sqrt{2})^2} = 2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2} = 4$$

So, the sides of the triangle are $a = 2\sqrt{2}$, $b = 2\sqrt{2}$, and $c = 4$. The perimeter is:

We also know that the point $P(1, \sqrt{2})$ lies on this graph, and the area of the triangle is $4$.

Let's start by finding the relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ using the area formula for a right triangle:

$$

    4 & = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \\\\

Now, we can use the fact that point $P(1, \sqrt{2})$ lies on the graph of the Pythagorean reciprocal function:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \sqrt{2} & = \frac{a+b}{c} \\\\
    c\sqrt{2} & = a + b \, .
\end{align*}
$$

We can square both sides of this equation to get:

$$
\begin{align*}
   2c^2 & = (a+b)^2 \\\\
   2c^2 & = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can substitute $ab = 8$ into this equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
   2c^2 & = a^2 + 2(8) + b^2 \\\\
   2c^2 & = a^2 + 16 + b^2 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Next, we can use the fact that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (from the Pythagorean theorem):

$$
\begin{align*}
   2c^2 & = c^2 + 16 \\\\
   c^2 & = 16 \\\\
   c & = 4 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now that we have $c$, we can find $a$ and $b$ using the equation $c\sqrt{2} = a + b$:

$$
\begin{align*}
    4\sqrt{2} & = a + b \\\\
    4\sqrt{2} & = a + \frac{8}{a} \quad \text{(since } ab = 8) \\\\
    a^2 - 4\sqrt{2}a + 8 & = 0 \, .

\begin{align*}
    a & = 2\sqrt{2}, \, \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \\\\
    b & = 2\sqrt{2}, \, \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} \, .

Since $a$ and $b$ are sides of a triangle, they must be positive, so we take $a = 2\sqrt{2}$ and $b = 2$.

Finally, we can calculate the perimeter:

$$

B: $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}$ is a rational function. As $x$ approaches $2$ from the left, the function approaches negative infinity. So, the function is not defined on the entire interval $(-\infty, 0)$. Hence, B is not the correct answer.

C: $f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 2$ is a quadratic function. We can find the vertex of the parabola by calculating $x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$.

Since $f(2) < 0$ and $f(x)$ is continuous, there exists an $x > 2$ such that $f(x) \leq 0$, which means $\log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) \leq 2$.

Therefore, the statement $\exists x > 2$, $\log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) \leq 2$ is true.

So, the final answer is:

**\[ \boxed{\text{A: } \neg p: \exists x > 2, \log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) \leq 2 \text{ and } \neg p \text{ is a true proposition}} \]**","The final answer provided in the ground truth solution is C: $¬p:∃x > 2,log _{2}(x+ \frac {4}{x})≤slant 2$ and $¬p$ is a false proposition.

The candidate solution provides the answer A: $¬p:∃x > 2,log _{2}(x+ \frac {4}{x})≤slant 2$ and $¬p$ is a true proposition.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it fails to recognise that the original proposition is true. The solution correctly finds the negation of the proposition, but then incorrectly determines that the negation is true. The solution should have evaluated the function at x = 2 and concluded that the original proposition is true, making its negation false.",False
239483,"The equation for a circle that passes through the origin, with its center on the negative x-axis and a radius equal to 2, is __________.","Let's denote the center of the circle as $(a, 0)$, with $a < 0$. 
Since the radius of the circle is 2, the equation of the circle is $(x - a)^2 + y^2 = 4$.

Moreover, since the origin $O(0, 0)$ lies on the circle, by substituting these coordinates into the circle's equation, we get:
$$(0 - a)^2 + 0^2 = 4.$$
Hence, we have $a^2 = 4$. Solving for $a$ yields $a = -2$ (the positive root is disregarded as $a$ is negative according to the problem statement).

Consequently, the equation of the circle is given by:
$$(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 4.$$
So, the answer is:
$$\boxed{(x+2)^2+y^2=4}.$$

The problem requires determining the standard equation of a circle based on given conditions, focusing on the knowledge of the circle's standard equation and the relationship between points and the circle's position. This is considered a basic-level question.",0,"Let's break down the problem and solve it systematically.

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:
- We are dealing with a circle that passes through the origin, which means the origin $(0, 0)$ is a point on the circle.
- The center of the circle is on the negative x-axis. This implies that the y-coordinate of the center is 0 (since all points on the x-axis have a y-coordinate of 0), and the x-coordinate is negative.
- The radius of the circle is given as 2.

2. **Finding the Center of the Circle**:
Since the center is on the negative x-axis and the radius is 2, the x-coordinate of the center must be $-2$. This is because the distance from the center to the origin (which is on the circle) must be equal to the radius. So, the center of the circle is at $(-2, 0)$.

3. **Writing the Equation of the Circle**:
The standard form of the equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$.

Plugging in our values:
- $h = -2$ (x-coordinate of the center)
- $k = 0$ (y-coordinate of the center)
- $r = 2$ (radius)

We get:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    (x - (-2))^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 2^2 \,.
\end{equation*}
$$

Simplifying the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
    (x + 2)^2 + y^2 & = 4 \\
    x^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 & = 4 \\
    x^2 + 4x + y^2 & = 0 \,.
\end{align*}
$$

So, the equation of the circle is:

$$
\boxed{x^2 + 4x + y^2 = 0} \,.
$$

This equation represents a circle that satisfies all the given conditions.","The final answer provided in the ground truth solution is:
$$\boxed{(x+2)^2+y^2=4}.$$

The candidate solution provides the following final answer:
$$\boxed{x^2 + 4x + y^2 = 0}.$$

The candidate solution is incorrect. The mistake lies in the simplification of the equation. When expanding $(x + 2)^2$, the candidate solution incorrectly distributes the square, resulting in $x^2 + 4x$ instead of the correct expansion $x^2 + 4x + 4$. This error leads to a different final equation for the circle.",False
