The principal has 4 students to recommend and there are 3 universities to choose from. Each university can accept at most 2 recommended students.

## Step 2: Breaking down the problem into cases
To calculate the total number of recommendation plans, we need to consider different scenarios based on how many students are recommended to each university.

## Step 3: Calculating the number of plans for each case
We can break down the problem into the following cases:
- All 4 students are recommended to the same university (not possible since each university can accept at most 2 students).
- 3 students are recommended to one university and 1 student to another (not possible since the first university can only accept 2 students).
- 2 students are recommended to one university and 2 students to another.
- 2 students are recommended to one university and 1 student each to the other two universities.

## Step 4: Calculating plans for 2 students to one university and 2 to another
First, select the university that gets 2 students, which can be done in 3 ways. Then, choose 2 students out of 4 to go to that university, which can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. Finally, choose 2 out of the remaining 2 students for the second university, which can be done in C(2,2) = 1 way. The last university gets no students. This results in 3 * 6 * 1 = 18 plans.

## Step 5: Calculating plans for 2 students to one university and 1 student each to the other two
Select the university that gets 2 students, which can be done in 3 ways. Then, choose 2 students out of 4 to go to that university, which can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. The remaining 2 students can be distributed to the other 2 universities in 2 ways (since the order in which they go to the universities matters for counting distinct plans). This results in 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 plans.

## Step 6: Summing up all possible plans
Adding the plans from step 4 and step 5 gives us the total number of recommendation plans the principal can make.

Next, choose 1 student out of the remaining 2 for one of the other universities, which can be done in C(2,1) = 2 ways. The last student automatically goes to the last university. However, since the two universities receiving one student each are distinct, we need to consider which university gets which student, resulting in 2 ways to distribute the last two students among the remaining universities. This results in 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 plans. ## Step 6: Adding the plans from all valid cases The total number of plans is the sum of plans from the valid cases: 18 (from Step 4) + 36 (from Step 5) cannot be directly added without considering overlap or distinct scenarios correctly based on the conditions given.
However, upon reevaluation considering the proper method to calculate these scenarios without overcounting or misinterpreting the conditions:

- For 2 students to one university and 2 to another, the correct calculation should consider choosing the universities and the students correctly.
- For 2 students to one university and 1 each to the others, the calculation should correctly account for all distinct distributions.

Given the conditions and clarifying the misunderstanding in calculation steps, let's correct the approach:

## Step 7: Correct Approach for Calculation First, consider distributing 2 students to one university and 2 to another. The correct way to think about it is selecting which universities get 2 students and then which students go where, but this scenario is not directly calculable as initially described due to the oversight of university selection limitations. Then, for 2 students to one university and 1 each to the others, the calculation involves selecting the university to get 2 students, then which 2 students go there, and finally how to distribute the remaining 2 students among the other 2 universities.

Next, choose 1 student out of the remaining 2 for one of the other universities, which can be done in C(2,1) = 2 ways, and the last student automatically goes to the last university. However, since the two universities that receive one student each are distinct, we must also consider which of the two universities gets which student, resulting in 2 ways to distribute the last two students among the remaining universities. This gives 3 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 36 plans. However, this overcounts because it distinguishes between the two universities that receive one student each. The correct approach should consider that once the university for 2 students is chosen and those 2 students are selected, the remaining 2 students can be distributed to the other 2 universities in 2! = 2 ways. Thus, the correct calculation for this scenario should be 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 plans. ## Step 6: Summing up the plans from all valid cases We only have valid plans from two scenarios: 2 students to one university and 2 to another (which we determined isn't valid upon reconsideration due to the 2-student limit per university), and 2 students to one university and 1 each to the others. The correct approach for the valid scenarios should consider the distribution without overcounting. The first valid scenario (2 to one, 2 to another) isn't actually valid given the constraints, so we focus on the corrected calculation for the second scenario (2 to one, 1 to each of the others), which we found to be 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 plans. However, the error in calculation and consideration of scenarios suggests a reevaluation is necessary based on the problem's constraints and the actual scenarios that are possible. Given the constraints, a simpler approach to calculating the total number of recommendation plans may be more appropriate, focusing on the direct selection and distribution of students to universities without overcomplicating the scenarios. The realization that the initial step-by-step breakdown may have introduced unnecessary complexity suggests a reconsideration of the problem with a focus on direct and simple combinatorial calculations based on the given constraints. Let's correct the approach by focusing on the selection and distribution process directly: For each of the 4 students, there are 3 choices of universities. However, since each university can only accept up to 2 students, we need to consider the combinations while respecting this limit. The error in previous steps was in prematurely concluding specific distributions without fully accounting for all possibilities within the given constraints. The correct approach involves recognizing the total number of ways to distribute the students while adhering to the 2-student limit per university, which involves combinatorial calculations that consider all possible distributions of students to universities, including the limitations imposed by the 2-student cap per university.

The solution then suggests a reevaluation and a simpler approach, focusing on direct combinatorial calculations.

The candidate solution concludes with the final answer of 36, which is incorrect. The error lies in the initial understanding of the problem constraints and the subsequent breakdown into cases.

Hence, the correct option is $\boxed{D}$.",1,"## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem.
The high school can recommend 4 students to three different universities, with each university able to accept at most 2 recommended students.

## Step 2: Enumerate the possibilities for distributing the 4 students across the 3 universities.
Given the constraint that each university can accept at most 2 students, the distribution possibilities are limited. The combinations can be as follows:
- (2, 2, 0): 2 students to one university, 2 to another, and none to the third. This can be rearranged in 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 6 ways since the universities are distinct, but the number of students each gets is the same.
- (2, 1, 1): 2 students to one university, 1 to another, and 1 to the last. This can be rearranged in 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 6 ways for the same reason.
These are the only distributions possible under the given constraints.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select students for each distribution scenario.
For the (2, 2, 0) scenario, we need to select 2 students out of 4 for the first university, and then 2 out of the remaining 2 for the second university. The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 6 * 1 = 6.
For the (2, 1, 1) scenario, we need to select 2 students out of 4 for the first university, then 1 out of the remaining 2 for the second university, and the last student automatically goes to the third university. The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of recommendation plans by combining the results from Step 2 and Step 3.
For (2, 2, 0), considering the 6 arrangements of universities, we have 6 * 6 = 36 ways.
For (2, 1, 1), considering the 6 arrangements of universities, we have 6 * 12 = 72 ways.
However, we need to consider the correct calculation based on the distinct arrangements of students across universities, taking into account the specific distribution scenarios correctly.

## Step 5: Correct the approach based on the actual question requirements.
We should directly consider how many ways the principal can recommend 4 students to 3 universities with the given constraints, focusing on the selection and arrangement of students rather than the distribution patterns alone.

## Step 6: Recalculate based on the correct understanding of the problem.
The correct approach involves considering each student's possible university assignments directly:
- Each of the 4 students can be recommended to any of the 3 universities, but with the constraint that no more than 2 students can be recommended to the same university.

## Step 7: Apply the correct method for calculating the number of recommendation plans.
Considering each student's options and the constraint, we can approach this as a problem of permutations with constraints. However, the direct calculation of specific distributions might be complex due to the overlapping possibilities and the need to consider each student's assignment individually.

## Step 8: Simplify the calculation by considering the problem's requirements directly.
Given the complexity of directly calculating each distribution, we should reconsider the basic principle of how many choices the principal has for each student and how these choices are constrained by the university's acceptance limit.

The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12. ## Step 4: Calculate the total number of recommendation plans by combining the results from Step 2 and Step 3. For (2, 2, 0), considering the 6 arrangements of universities, we have 6 * 6 = 36 ways. For (2, 1, 1), considering the 6 arrangements of universities, we have 6 * 12 = 72 ways. However, we need to consider the correct calculation based on the distinct arrangements of students across universities, taking into account the specific distribution scenarios correctly. ## Step 5: Correct the approach based on the actual question requirements. We should directly consider how many ways the principal can recommend 4 students to 3 universities with the given constraints, focusing on the selection"," and arrangement of students rather than just the distribution patterns. This involves calculating the combinations for each feasible distribution directly and summing them up. The error in previous steps was in prematurely calculating without fully considering the distinct selection processes for each university based on the constraints given. The proper approach involves recognizing the combinations for placing students into the limited slots available at each university, respecting the maximum of 2 students per university.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it does not consider all the possible cases. The solution correctly identifies the distribution possibilities as (2, 2, 0) and (2, 1, 1), but it fails to account for the fact that the universities are distinct. In the (2, 2, 0) case, there are 6 ways to choose the universities, but the solution multiplies this by 6 again, assuming that the universities are interchangeable. This is incorrect because the universities are distinct entities, and their order matters. Similarly, for the (2, 1, 1) case, the solution calculates 6 * 12 = 72 ways, but this is incorrect as it double-counts the arrangements. The correct way to calculate the number of ways for this case is to consider the number of ways to choose 2 universities out of 3 for the first two students (C(3,2) = 3) and then multiply it by the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 4 for the first university and 1 student out of the remaining 2 for the second university (C(4,2) * C(2,1) = 12).

Hence, the correct option is $\boxed{D}$.",2,"## Step 1: Determine the number of students and universities
There are 4 students to be recommended and 3 universities to choose from.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to recommend students to each university without restrictions
For each student, there are 3 choices of universities, so without any restrictions, the total number of ways to recommend the students would be $3^4 = 81$.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of invalid recommendations where more than 2 students are recommended to the same university
To find the number of invalid recommendations, we'll consider the cases where more than 2 students are recommended to the same university. This can happen in three ways: all 4 students are recommended to the same university, or 3 students are recommended to one university and 1 to another.

## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to recommend all 4 students to the same university
There are 3 ways to choose the university, and then all 4 students must go to that university. However, this is not possible since each university can accept at most 2 recommended students.

## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to recommend 3 students to one university and 1 student to another
There are 3 choices for the university that gets 3 students, then $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose which 3 students go to that university, and 2 choices for where the last student goes. This results in $3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24$ invalid recommendations.

## Step 6: Account for the double-counting in Step 5
Each invalid recommendation where 3 students go to one university and 1 to another is counted twice because the order of choosing the universities doesn't matter. However, upon closer inspection, this step is actually unnecessary for the calculation because we are directly counting distinct distributions of students to universities that violate the rule, not counting paths or sequences that could be reversed or otherwise overcounted in a manner requiring correction.

## Step 7: Subtract the number of invalid recommendations from the total to find the valid recommendations
However, we recognize that the approach taken in steps 3-6 to directly calculate and subtract invalid recommendations may not be the most straightforward path to the solution. A simpler approach would involve directly counting the valid distributions by considering the constraints from the outset.

## Step 8: Reconsider the problem and apply a combinatorial approach directly
Given the constraint that each university can accept at most 2 students, we can enumerate the possibilities more directly: (2,2,0), (2,1,1), and (2,0,2), (1,2,1), (1,1,2), (0,2,2) where the numbers represent how many students are sent to each of the three universities. For (2,2,0), there are $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 6$ ways. For (2,1,1) and its permutations, there are $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{1}{1} = 12$ ways for each unique distribution, and there are 3 unique distributions (2,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2). Thus, the total number of valid recommendations is the sum of these possibilities.

## Step 9: Calculate the total number of valid recommendations
The calculation from step 8 yields: $6 + 3 \times 12 = 6 + 36 = 42$ is incorrect because we overcomplicated the enumeration. Let's simplify: The correct approach should directly consider the valid distributions of students to universities without overcounting. For 4 students and 3 universities with a limit of 2 students per university, we can have distributions like (2,2,0), (2,1,1), and their permutations. For (2,2,0), the calculation is $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 6$, and there are 3 ways to choose which university gets 0 students, leading to $6 \times 3 = 18$ for this distribution type. For (2,1,1), we choose 2 students for one university, 1 for another, and the last student goes to the last university. The calculation for choosing students is $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{1}{1}$, but we must account for the different university orders, which is already considered in recognizing the distinct permutations of (2,1,1).

## Step 10: Correct the approach based on distribution types
We should correct our approach to directly calculate based on feasible distributions without incorrectly expanding the scope. For the (2,2,0) scenario, there are indeed $3 \times \binom{4}{2} = 18$ ways because we choose which university gets no students and then which 2 of the 4 students go to each of the other two universities. For the (2,1,1) scenario and its permutations, we calculate the student distribution as $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{1}{1}$ but then must correctly account for university choices.

## Step 11: Final calculation for valid recommendations
For (2,2,0), we correctly identified 18 possibilities. For (2,1,1) and its permutations, considering the 3 different orders (which university gets 2 students), we calculate $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times 3 = 36$. Summing these, $18 + 36 = 54$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$","The final answer of the ground truth solution is D: 54.

The final answer of the candidate solution is 36.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it does not consider all the possible cases for distributing the students among the universities. In Step 8, the solution correctly identifies the valid distributions as (2,2,0), (2,1,1), and their permutations. However, in Step 9, when calculating the number of ways for the (2,2,0) distribution, it incorrectly multiplies the number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 by the number of ways to choose 2 universities from 3. This is an overcount, as the universities are not interchangeable in this case; there is only one way to choose the universities for this distribution. The correct calculation for (2,2,0) should be $3 \times \binom{4}{2} = 18$, as there are 3 ways to choose the university with no students and then $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 students from the remaining 4.

The solution then continues with an incorrect approach in Step 10, attempting to correct the previous mistake but introducing a new error. It correctly identifies the need to account for university choices but does not do so correctly. For the (2,1,1) distribution and its permutations, there are indeed 3 different orders to consider, but the calculation should be $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{1}{1} \times 3 = 36$, as the university choices are distinct and should be multiplied by 3.

Thus, the total number of valid recommendations is the sum of these possibilities. ## Step 9: Calculate the total number of valid recommendations The calculation from step 8 yields: $6 + 3 \times 12 = 6 + 36 = 42$ is incorrect because we overcomplicated the enumeration. Let's simplify: The correct approach should directly consider the valid distributions of students to universities without overcounting. For 4 students and 3 universities with a limit of"," 2 students per university, we should look at combinations directly: The cases to consider are how to distribute the students so that no more than 2 go to any one university. The direct counting in step 8 was overly complicated. A simpler method is to consider each student's options and the limitations directly imposed by the universities' caps. ## Step 10: Recalculate using a corrected and simplified approach Let's reconsider the direct enumeration and calculation: We need to distribute 4 students into 3 groups (universities) with no group having more than 2 students. This can be broken down into cases like (2,2,0), (2,1,1), and their permutations among the universities. For (2,2,0), the calculation is $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{2} = 6$, and there are 3 ways to choose which university gets 0 students, so $6 \times 3 = 18$ for this distribution. For (2,1,1), the calculation is $\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{1}{1} = 12$, and there are 3 ways to choose which university gets 2 students, so $12 \times 3 = 36$ for this distribution. However, the approach to directly calculate and sum these specific distributions was misleading because the initial enumeration and calculation method was flawed. ## Step 11: Final Calculation Recognizing the mistake in the overcomplicated and incorrect enumeration, let's finally approach the problem with the correct insight: We should directly consider the number of ways to select students for each university, respecting the limit of 2 students per university. The calculation should reflect the choices available for each distribution that meets the criteria, without overcounting. Given the constraints, the principal can recommend students in the following unique distributions that do not exceed 2 students per university: sending 2 students to one university and 2 to another, or sending 2 to one and 1 each to the others. The correct enumeration should directly calculate the number of ways to achieve these distributions without exceeding the university limits. Therefore, considering correct principles of combinatorics and the constraints provided, we recognize the error in previous steps and understand that a more straightforward application of combinatorial rules is required to solve the problem accurately.

The principal has 4 students to recommend and there are 3 universities to choose from. Each university can accept at most 2 recommended students.

## Step 2: Breaking down the problem into cases
To calculate the total number of recommendation plans, we need to consider different scenarios based on how many students are recommended to each university.

## Step 3: Calculating the number of plans for each case
We can break down the problem into the following cases:
- All 4 students are recommended to the same university (not possible since each university can accept at most 2 students).
- 3 students are recommended to one university and 1 student to another (not possible since the first university can only accept 2 students).

Finally, choose 2 out of the remaining 2 students for the second university, which can be done in C(2,2) = 1 way. The last university gets no students. This results in 3 * 6 * 1 = 18 plans.

Select the university that gets 2 students, which can be done in 3 ways. Then, choose 2 students out of 4 to go to that university, which can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. The remaining 2 students can be distributed to the other 2 universities in 2 ways (since the order in which they go to the universities matters for counting distinct plans).

Hence, the correct option is $\boxed{D}$.",4,"## Step 1: Determine the number of students to be recommended and the number of universities available.
There are 4 students to be recommended and 3 universities to choose from.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to recommend students to each university without exceeding the limit of 2 students per university.
To simplify, we consider the recommendation process step by step for each student, taking into account the restrictions imposed by the universities.

## Step 3: Consider the cases based on how many students are recommended to each university.
We break down the problem into cases based on the distribution of students across universities:
- All 4 students to one university (not possible due to the 2-student limit per university).
- 3 students to one university and 1 to another (not possible due to the 2-student limit).
- 2 students to one university and 2 to another.
- 2 students to one university and 1 each to the other two universities.
- 1 student to each of the three universities, with the fourth student having 3 options (each of the universities).

## Step 4: Calculate the number of recommendation plans for each valid case.
### For 2 students to one university and 2 to another:
- Choose the university for the first 2 students: 3 choices.
- Choose 2 students out of 4 for the first university: C(4,2) = 6 ways.
- The remaining 2 students automatically go to another university. There are 2 universities left, but since we've already chosen 2 students for one university, the remaining students will go to one of the 2 remaining universities, but we must account for which pair goes to which university, so we effectively have 2 choices for which university the first pair goes to, but this is already accounted for in choosing the first university.
So, this case yields 3 * 6 = 18 ways.

### For 2 students to one university and 1 each to the other two:
- Choose the university for the 2 students: 3 choices.
- Choose 2 students out of 4 for this university: C(4,2) = 6 ways.
- For the remaining 2 students, there are 2 ways to distribute them among the 2 other universities (since each of these universities must get exactly one of the remaining students, and there are 2 choices for which student goes to which of the 2 universities).
So, this case yields 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 ways.

### For 1 student to each of the three universities, with the fourth student having 3 options:
- Choose 3 students out of 4 to go to the 3 different universities: C(4,3) = 4 ways.
- Distribute these 3 students among the universities: 3! = 6 ways.
- The fourth student can go to any of the 3 universities: 3 choices.
So, this case yields 4 * 6 * 3 = 72 ways, but this counts each distribution where the fourth student is added to one of the universities as distinct from the same distribution without the fourth student added. However, we should consider this calculation more carefully as it reflects a different approach to counting that doesn't align with the case-based analysis we started with.

## Step 5: Correctly approach the calculation for distributing students across universities without exceeding the 2-student limit.
Upon reflection, the approach should focus on the selection and distribution based on the constraints directly:
- The first student can choose any of the 3 universities.
- The second student can also choose any of the 3 universities.
- The third student has the same choices, but we must account for the constraint of no more than 2 students per university.
- The fourth student's choices are constrained by the previous selections.

This step requires reevaluation based on the constraint of at most 2 students per university, simplifying the approach by directly considering the choices available to each student sequentially while adhering to the constraint.

## Step 6: Recalculate based on sequential student choices with constraints.
Let's reconsider the calculation with the proper step-by-step allocation, accounting for the constraint that each university can accept at most 2 recommended students:
- The first student has 3 choices.
- The second student also has 3 choices.
- The third student, depending on the choices of the first two, might have 3 choices if the first two chose different universities, but if they chose the same, the third student has 2 choices (excluding the university that already has 2 students, which isn't possible at this point but becomes relevant for the fourth student).
- The fourth student's choices depend on the distribution of the first three students. If all three went to different universities, the fourth has 3 choices but with a limit of 2 per university, implying specific constraints based on previous choices.

## Step 7: Final calculation approach.
To simplify, we directly calculate the possible distributions considering the constraint:
- Each student has 3 initial choices, but the choices diminish as the 2-student limit per university is approached.
Given the constraint and the need to distribute 4 students, a straightforward calculation can be derived from considering the combinations of students to universities directly, taking into account the limit.

However, the step-by-step breakdown provided initially may not directly lead to the most straightforward calculation method for this specific problem. The essence lies in considering how many ways the 4 students can be distributed among the 3 universities without exceeding the limit of 2 students per university.

## Step 8: Simplify the calculation by focusing on the direct distribution of students to universities with constraints.
Let's simplify by considering the possible distributions:
- (2,2,0), (2,1,1), and (1,1,1, with one university having an additional student) are the base distributions, but given the limit, we focus on feasible distributions under the constraints.

If two students are already at one university, the fourth student has only 2 choices (the other two universities), but if the first three students are distributed with one student in each of two universities and one university not chosen, the fourth student has 3 choices but must consider the limit. This step involves complex considerations of combinations and permutations under constraints, suggesting a need for a more streamlined approach. ## Step 7: Streamline the approach by focusing on direct counting methods that account for all possibilities under the given constraints. A direct counting method considering all possibilities under the constraints is necessary for accuracy. Given the complexity of distributing students under the constraints, we consider each student's choice and how it affects subsequent choices, ensuring we do not exceed the limits set by the universities. This involves breaking down the problem into manageable cases and ensuring each case adheres to the constraints provided. However, a straightforward enumeration considering the restrictions directly may provide a clearer path to the solution. ## Step 8: Enumerate the possibilities directly based on constraints. To simplify, let's directly enumerate the possibilities or use a combinatorial approach that fits the constraints: - Each student can be recommended to one of the three universities, but no university can receive more than 2 recommendations. This can be approached by considering the distribution patterns that satisfy the condition and calculating the number of ways for each pattern. The patterns include having 2 students at one university and 2 at another, or having 2 at one university and 1 each at the others. For the case of 2 students at one university and 2 at another, the calculation is straightforward: choose 2 students out of 4 for the first university (C(4,2)), and the remaining 2 go to another university. There are 3 choices for which university the first 2 students go to, and once that's decided, there are 2 choices for where the second pair goes, but this overcounts because the pairs are indistinguishable in terms of university assignment. For the case of 2 students at one university and 1 each at the others, the calculation involves choosing 2 students for one university and then distributing the remaining 2 students among the other 2 universities, which can be done in a straightforward manner. This direct enumeration approach helps ensure all possibilities are considered accurately under the constraints. The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$",True,"The final answer of the ground truth solution is D, which corresponds to 54.

The candidate solution also arrives at the correct answer of 54. However, the answer is not boxed, and the solution is quite lengthy and complex, making it difficult to follow.

So, this case yields 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 ways. ### For 1 student to each of the three universities, with the fourth student having 3 options: - Choose 3 students out of 4 to go to the 3 different universities: C(4,3) = 4 ways. - Distribute these 3 students among the universities: 3! = 6 ways. - The fourth student can go to any of the 3 universities: 3 choices. So, this case yields 4 * 6 * 3 = 72 ways, but this counts each distribution where the fourth student is added to one of the universities as distinct from the same distribution without the fourth student added. However, we should consider this calculation more carefully as it reflects a different approach to counting that doesn't align with the case-based analysis we started with. ## Step 5: Correctly approach the calculation for distributing students across universities without exceeding the 2-student limit. Upon reflection, the approach should focus on the selection and distribution based on the constraints directly: - The first student can choose any of the 3 universities. - The second student can also choose any of the 3 universities. - The third student has the same choices, but we must account for the constraint of no more than 2 students per university. - The fourth student's choices are constrained by the previous selections. This step requires reevaluation based on the constraint of at most 2 students per university, simplifying the approach by directly considering the choices available to each student sequentially while adhering to the constraint. ## Step 6: Recalculate based on sequential student choices with constraints. Let's reconsider the calculation with the proper step-by-step allocation, accounting for the"," constraint that each university can accept at most 2 students: - For the first student, there are 3 choices (universities). - For the second student, there are also 3 choices, but we must consider the combinations where no more than 2 students are at any university. - We continue this pattern for all 4 students, ensuring we do not exceed the limit for any university. However, the correct approach to solving this problem should involve calculating the possible distributions directly based on the constraints given, which was misunderstood in the initial step-by-step breakdown. The correct calculation directly considers the number of ways to distribute the students under the given constraints without overcounting or misinterpreting the scenarios. Given the constraints and the goal to find the number of recommendation plans, we need to consider each student's options and how they can be distributed. The mistake in the calculation process was in overcomplicating the scenarios and not directly addressing the constraint of at most 2 students per university in a straightforward manner. ## Step 7: Apply the correct calculation method based on student distribution and university constraints. For each of the 4 students, there are initially 3 choices (the 3 universities). However, as students are assigned, the choices for subsequent students may decrease due to the 2-student limit per university. The first student has 3 options, the second also has 3 options (since we can have 2 students at one university), but for the third and fourth students, their options depend on the previous selections. If 2 students are already at one university, the next student has only 2 options (the other two universities), and the pattern continues, ensuring that no university exceeds the 2-student limit. Let's correct the calculation process and directly calculate the possible distributions under these constraints. Given the error in the detailed step-by-step process and the need for a clear, direct calculation method, let's focus on the final answer determination based on the corrected understanding of the problem constraints and requirements.

A: $x \lt -2$

B: $x \lt 2$

C: $x \gt -2$

D: $x \gt 2$","Given that the solution to $mx+n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can analyze the inequality step by step:

1. For $mx+n > 0$ to have a solution of $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it implies that when $x$ is substituted with $\frac{1}{2}$, the inequality $mx+n$ should switch from being positive to non-positive. This indicates that $m$ must be negative, i.e., $m < 0$, because as $x$ increases, $mx$ decreases if $m$ is negative.

2. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality and setting it to equality gives us $m\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+n = 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = -\frac{m}{2}$. Since $m < 0$, it follows that $n > 0$.

3. The relationship $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$ comes from rearranging the equation $n = -\frac{m}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

4. Now, looking at the inequality $nx-m < 0$, we want to find its solution set. We can rewrite this inequality as $x < \frac{m}{n}$ by adding $m$ to both sides and then dividing by $n$, assuming $n > 0$ (which we have established).

5. Substituting $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{m}{n}$ gives us $\frac{m}{n} = -2$. This is because flipping the fraction $\frac{n}{m}$ to $\frac{m}{n}$ is equivalent to taking the reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $-2$.

6. Therefore, the solution to $nx-m < 0$ is $x < -2$.

Hence, the correct answer is $\boxed{A}$.",0,"## Step 1: Understanding the first inequality
The given inequality is $mx + n > 0$, and its solution is $x < \frac{1}{2}$. This implies that the expression $mx + n$ is positive for all values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 2: Finding the relation between $m$ and $n$
To find the relation between $m$ and $n$, we can use the boundary value of $x$, which is $\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality $mx + n > 0$ gives us $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n > 0$. Simplifying this, we get $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$.

## Step 3: Determining the sign of $m$
Since the solution to the inequality $mx + n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it means that as $x$ decreases (becomes more negative), $mx + n$ remains positive. This can only happen if $m$ is negative, because then $mx$ becomes positive as $x$ becomes negative, contributing to the overall positivity of $mx + n$.

## Step 4: Analyzing the second inequality
The second inequality is $nx - m < 0$. Given that $m$ is negative, $-m$ is positive. For $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ must be less than $m$ (a negative value), implying $nx < 0$ since $m$ is negative.

## Step 5: Determining the solution set of the second inequality
Since $m$ is negative, for $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ must also be negative to satisfy the inequality. Knowing $m$ is negative and considering $nx < m$, if $n$ is positive, $x$ must be negative to make $nx$ negative. However, we need to determine the relation between $n$ and $m$ more precisely to solve $nx - m < 0$.

## Step 6: Using the boundary condition to relate $m$ and $n$
From Step 2, we have $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$. Since $m$ is negative, $n$ must be positive to satisfy this inequality. Thus, $n > -\frac{m}{2}$.

## Step 7: Solving $nx - m < 0$
Given $n > 0$ (from Step 6, as $n$ must be positive to satisfy $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$ with $m$ being negative), $x$ must be such that $nx < m$. Since $m$ is negative, $nx$ must also be negative, implying $x < 0$.

## Step 8: Finding the exact bound for $x$
To find the exact bound for $x$, we use the fact that $m$ and $n$ are related through the inequality $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$. However, without a specific value for $m$ or $n$, we look at the condition given by the inequality $nx - m < 0$. This implies $nx < m$, and since $m$ is negative, $nx$ must also be negative. Given $n$ is positive, $x$ must be negative.

## Step 9: Relating the boundary of $x$ in the second inequality to the options
Considering $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for the first inequality and knowing $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, we need to find how $x$ relates to $-\frac{m}{n}$ in the inequality $nx - m < 0$. The boundary condition for $x$ in this case would be when $nx = m$, but since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, $x$ would be negative.

## Step 10: Finalizing the solution set
Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, and considering the inequality $nx - m < 0$, for $nx$ to be less than $m$ (a negative value), $x$ must be such that $nx$ is negative, implying $x$ is negative since $n$ is positive. The exact bound for $x$ would depend on the values of $m$ and $n$, but given the options and understanding that $x$ must be negative, we can proceed to determine the most appropriate answer.

We cannot directly calculate $\frac{m}{n}$ without specific values for $m$ and $n$, but we can infer the relationship from the given solution to the first inequality. The condition $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for $mx + n > 0$ implies that when $x = \frac{1}{2}$, $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n = 0$ for the boundary case, giving us $m + 2n = 0$ or $m = -2n$. Substituting $m = -2n$ into $x < \frac{m}{n}$ gives $x < \frac{-2n}{n} = -2$. Thus, the solution set to $nx - m < 0$ is $x < -2$.

Given that $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, we want to find when $nx - m < 0$. Since $n$ is positive, $nx$ will be negative for $x < 0$ and positive for $x > 0$. Given that $m$ is negative, subtracting a negative $m$ from $nx$ means we are essentially adding a positive value to $nx$. For $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ must be negative enough to overcome the addition of $-m$ (which is equivalent to adding a positive value since $m$ is negative).

## Step 4: Solve $nx - m < 0$ considering the signs of $m$ and $n$
Since $n > 0$ and $m < 0$, for $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ needs to be less than $m$ (a negative value) to ensure the overall expression is less than zero. Given that $m$ is a constant negative value, $n$ being positive means that $x$ must be sufficiently negative to make $nx$ small enough (more negative) to be less than $m$.

## Step 5: Determine the exact boundary for $x$
To find the boundary, set $nx - m = 0$ and solve for $x$. This gives $nx = m$, and thus $x = \frac{m}{n}$. Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, $\frac{m}{n}$ will be negative.

## Step 6: Recall the original inequality solution to inform about $m$ and $n$
The solution $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for $mx + n > 0$ implies that when $x = \frac{1}{2}$, $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n = 0$ because it's the boundary condition. This gives $\frac{m}{2} + n = 0$, or $m = -2n$.

## Step 7: Solve for the boundary in $nx - m < 0$ using $m = -2n$
Substitute $m = -2n$ into $x = \frac{m}{n}$ to find the boundary for $nx - m < 0$. This gives $x = \frac{-2n}{n} = -2$.

## Step 8: Determine the solution set based on the boundary
Since $x$ must be such that $nx - m < 0$, and knowing $x = -2$ is the boundary where $nx - m = 0$, for $nx - m$ to be less than zero, $x$ must be greater than $-2$ because $n$ is positive and $m$ is negative.

In Step 5, the candidate solution correctly identifies that $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, but it does not accurately interpret the implications of these signs on the inequality.

C: $x \gt -2$

D: $x \gt 2$","Given that the solution to $mx+n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can analyze the inequality step by step:

1. For $mx+n > 0$ to have a solution of $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it implies that when $x$ is substituted with $\frac{1}{2}$, the inequality $mx+n$ should switch from being positive to non-positive. This indicates that $m$ must be negative, i.e., $m < 0$, because as $x$ increases, $mx$ decreases if $m$ is negative.

2. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality and setting it to equality gives us $m\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+n = 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = -\frac{m}{2}$. Since $m < 0$, it follows that $n > 0$.

3. The relationship $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$ comes from rearranging the equation $n = -\frac{m}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

4. Now, looking at the inequality $nx-m < 0$, we want to find its solution set. We can rewrite this inequality as $x < \frac{m}{n}$ by adding $m$ to both sides and then dividing by $n$, assuming $n > 0$ (which we have established).

5. Substituting $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{m}{n}$ gives us $\frac{m}{n} = -2$. This is because flipping the fraction $\frac{n}{m}$ to $\frac{m}{n}$ is equivalent to taking the reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $-2$.

To find the boundary, set $nx - m = 0$ and solve for $x$. This gives $nx = m$, and thus $x = \frac{m}{n}$. Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, $\frac{m}{n}$ will be negative.

## Step 6: Recall the original inequality solution to inform about $m$ and $n$
The solution $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for $mx + n > 0$ implies that when $x = \frac{1}{2}$, $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n = 0$ because it's the boundary condition. This gives $\frac{m}{2} + n = 0$, or $m = -2n$.

D: $x \gt 2$","Given that the solution to $mx+n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can analyze the inequality step by step:

1. For $mx+n > 0$ to have a solution of $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it implies that when $x$ is substituted with $\frac{1}{2}$, the inequality $mx+n$ should switch from being positive to non-positive. This indicates that $m$ must be negative, i.e., $m < 0$, because as $x$ increases, $mx$ decreases if $m$ is negative.

2. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality and setting it to equality gives us $m\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+n = 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = -\frac{m}{2}$. Since $m < 0$, it follows that $n > 0$.

3. The relationship $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$ comes from rearranging the equation $n = -\frac{m}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

4. Now, looking at the inequality $nx-m < 0$, we want to find its solution set. We can rewrite this inequality as $x < \frac{m}{n}$ by adding $m$ to both sides and then dividing by $n$, assuming $n > 0$ (which we have established).

5. Substituting $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{m}{n}$ gives us $\frac{m}{n} = -2$. This is because flipping the fraction $\frac{n}{m}$ to $\frac{m}{n}$ is equivalent to taking the reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $-2$.

6. Therefore, the solution to $nx-m < 0$ is $x < -2$.

Hence, the correct answer is $\boxed{A}$.",2,"## Step 1: Understand the given inequality and its solution
The given inequality is $mx + n > 0$, and its solution is $x < \frac{1}{2}$. This implies that the inequality holds true for all values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 2: Determine the sign of $m$ and its implications
For the inequality $mx + n > 0$ to hold true when $x < \frac{1}{2}$, $m$ must be negative. This is because if $m$ were positive, the inequality would be true for $x > -\frac{n}{m}$, which does not match the given condition. A negative $m$ means that as $x$ increases, $mx$ becomes more negative, and thus to keep the inequality true, $n$ must be positive to counterbalance the effect of $mx$.

## Step 3: Analyze the second inequality $nx - m < 0$
Given $n$ is positive and $m$ is negative, we need to find when $nx - m < 0$. This can be rearranged to $nx < m$. Since $m$ is negative, $nx$ must be less than a negative number, implying $x$ must be negative because $n$ is positive.

## Step 4: Solve for $x$ in $nx < m$
To find the boundary value of $x$, we set $nx = m$ and solve for $x$. This gives $x = \frac{m}{n}$. However, we know from the first inequality that $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for $mx + n > 0$, which implies that $m$ and $n$ have opposite signs and that the solution to the second inequality must consider the relationship between $m$ and $n$ derived from the first inequality.

## Step 5: Use the information from the first inequality to infer about the second
Since we know $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, and from the first inequality that $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we cannot directly derive $\frac{m}{n}$ without specific values of $m$ and $n$. However, understanding that $x$ must be less than a certain value for the second inequality to hold true, given $n$ is positive and $m$ is negative, we look for a condition that matches the options provided.

## Step 6: Consider the boundary condition for the second inequality
Given $nx < m$, and knowing $m$ is negative, $x$ must be negative enough to make $nx$ less than $m$. The exact boundary depends on $\frac{m}{n}$, but since we're looking for a condition that $x$ must satisfy in relation to given options, we consider how $m$ and $n$ influence the direction of the inequality.

## Step 7: Match the solution to the given options
Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, and considering the inequality $nx < m$, $x$ must be negative. The question is how negative. The options suggest specific values, but without the exact ratio of $m$ to $n$, we must infer based on the behavior of linear inequalities. Given that $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for the first inequality, and knowing the signs of $m$ and $n$, we can reason about the direction and relative magnitude of $x$ for the second inequality.

## Step 8: Deduce the final answer based on the signs of $m$ and $n$ and the behavior of linear inequalities
Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, for $nx - m < 0$, $x$ must be such that $nx$ is less than a negative number ($m$). This suggests $x$ is negative, but without the exact values of $m$ and $n$, we look at the options provided to determine which one aligns with the requirement that $x$ is negative and satisfies the inequality given the signs of $m$ and $n$.

The candidate solution provides a detailed and well-structured approach to solving the problem, but it reaches an incorrect final answer. The key issue arises in Step 4, where the candidate solution sets $nx = m$ and solves for $x$, resulting in $x = \frac{m}{n}$. This step is incorrect because it assumes that $nx = m$ is a valid equation to consider. However, the relationship between $m$ and $n$ is more complex due to the constraints from the first inequality.

In the ground truth solution, it is correctly identified that the relationship between $m$ and $n$ is $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$. This relationship is crucial and should be used to determine the boundary value of $x$ for the second inequality.

For the inequality $mx + n > 0$ to hold true when $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it means that when $x$ is less than $\frac{1}{2}$, the expression $mx + n$ must be positive. This indicates that the value of $m$ and $n$ must be such that they make $mx + n$ positive in the interval $x < \frac{1}{2}$.

This implies that the inequality is satisfied for all values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$. ## Step 2: Analyzing the conditions for the first inequality For the inequality $mx + n > 0$ to hold true when $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it means that when $x$ is less than $\frac{1}{2}$, the expression $mx + n$ must be positive. This indicates that the value of $m$ and $n$ must be such that they make $mx + n$ positive in the interval $x < \frac{1}{2}$. ## Step 3: Finding the relationship between $m$ and $n$ Given that the solution to $mx + n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can substitute $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality to find the relationship between $m$ and $n$. When $x = \frac{1}{2}$, the inequality becomes $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n > 0$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}m + n > 0$. However, since $x < \frac{1}{2}$ is the solution, the boundary condition should make the inequality equal to zero, so $\frac{1}{2}m + n = 0$. ## Step 4: Solving for the relationship between $m$ and $n$ From the equation $\frac{1}{2}m + n = 0$, we can solve for $n$ in terms of $m$. Rearranging the equation gives $n = -\frac{1}{2}m$. ## Step 5: Analyzing the second inequality The second inequality is $nx - m < 0$. Substituting $n = -\frac{1}{2}m$ into this"," inequality gives $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$. Simplifying this expression yields $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$. ## Step 6: Solving the second inequality Dividing the inequality $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$ by $-1$ (and flipping the inequality sign because of dividing by a negative number) gives $\frac{1}{2}mx + m > 0$. Factoring out $m$ yields $m(\frac{1}{2}x + 1) > 0$. For this inequality to be true, either both $m > 0$ and $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 > 0$, or both $m < 0$ and $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 < 0$. ## Step 7: Solving for $x$ in the inequality $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 > 0$ Solving $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 > 0$ gives $\frac{1}{2}x > -1$, which simplifies to $x > -2$. ## Step 8: Considering the conditions for $m$ Since we know from the given solution that $x < \frac{1}{2}$ satisfies $mx + n > 0$, and given the relationship between $m$ and $n$, $m$ must be negative for the inequality $mx + n > 0$ to be satisfied when $x < \frac{1}{2}$. This is because as $x$ becomes more negative, $mx$ becomes positive (since $m$ is negative), ensuring the sum $mx + n$ is positive. Thus, $m < 0$. ## Step 9: Finding the solution set to $nx - m < 0$ Given that $m < 0$, the inequality $m(\frac{1}{2}x + 1) > 0$ implies $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 < 0$ because $m$ is negative. Solving $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 < 0$ gives $\frac{1}{2}x < -1$, which simplifies to $x < -2$.

The candidate solution is mostly correct and follows a similar line of reasoning as the ground truth solution. However, there are a few minor issues and discrepancies:

- In Step 3, the candidate solution mentions that ""the boundary condition should make the inequality equal to zero,"" but it doesn't explicitly state that this is because the solution is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, which is a critical detail.

- In Step 4, the candidate solution correctly solves for $n$ in terms of $m$, but it doesn't explicitly state that $n > 0$ (which is important for the next steps).

- In Step 6, the candidate solution simplifies the inequality to $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$, but it doesn't mention that this is equivalent to $mx + 2n < 0$ (which is the form used in the ground truth solution).

- In Step 7, the candidate solution divides the inequality by $-1$ and flips the sign, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is because $m < 0$ (which is a crucial condition).

A: $x \lt -2$

B: $x \lt 2$

C: $x \gt -2$

D: $x \gt 2$","Given that the solution to $mx+n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can analyze the inequality step by step:

1. For $mx+n > 0$ to have a solution of $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it implies that when $x$ is substituted with $\frac{1}{2}$, the inequality $mx+n$ should switch from being positive to non-positive. This indicates that $m$ must be negative, i.e., $m < 0$, because as $x$ increases, $mx$ decreases if $m$ is negative.

2. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality and setting it to equality gives us $m\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+n = 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = -\frac{m}{2}$. Since $m < 0$, it follows that $n > 0$.

3. The relationship $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$ comes from rearranging the equation $n = -\frac{m}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

4. Now, looking at the inequality $nx-m < 0$, we want to find its solution set. We can rewrite this inequality as $x < \frac{m}{n}$ by adding $m$ to both sides and then dividing by $n$, assuming $n > 0$ (which we have established).

5. Substituting $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{m}{n}$ gives us $\frac{m}{n} = -2$. This is because flipping the fraction $\frac{n}{m}$ to $\frac{m}{n}$ is equivalent to taking the reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $-2$.

6. Therefore, the solution to $nx-m < 0$ is $x < -2$.

Hence, the correct answer is $\boxed{A}$.",4,"## Step 1: Understanding the first inequality
The given inequality is $mx + n > 0$, and its solution is $x < \frac{1}{2}$. This implies that the inequality is satisfied for all values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 2: Analyzing the conditions for the first inequality
For the inequality $mx + n > 0$ to hold true when $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it means that when $x$ is less than $\frac{1}{2}$, the expression $mx + n$ must be positive. This indicates that the value of $m$ and $n$ must be such that they make $mx + n$ positive in the interval $x < \frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 3: Finding the relationship between $m$ and $n$
Given that the solution to $mx + n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can substitute $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality to find the relationship between $m$ and $n$. When $x = \frac{1}{2}$, the inequality becomes $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n > 0$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}m + n > 0$. However, since $x < \frac{1}{2}$ is the solution, the boundary condition should make the inequality equal to zero, so $\frac{1}{2}m + n = 0$.

## Step 4: Solving for the relationship between $m$ and $n$
From the equation $\frac{1}{2}m + n = 0$, we can solve for $n$ in terms of $m$. Rearranging the equation gives $n = -\frac{1}{2}m$.

## Step 5: Analyzing the second inequality
The second inequality is $nx - m < 0$. Substituting $n = -\frac{1}{2}m$ into this inequality gives $(-\frac{1}{2}m)x - m < 0$.

## Step 6: Simplifying the second inequality
Simplifying the inequality $(-\frac{1}{2}m)x - m < 0$ gives $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$. Rearranging this inequality, we get $-\frac{1}{2}mx < m$.

## Step 7: Solving the inequality for $x$
Dividing both sides of the inequality $-\frac{1}{2}mx < m$ by $-\frac{1}{2}m$ requires us to reverse the inequality sign because we are dividing by a negative quantity (assuming $m$ is positive, since if $m$ is negative, the inequality sign would not change, but the solution process would lead to a similar conclusion). Thus, we get $x > -2$.

When $x = \frac{1}{2}$, the inequality becomes $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n > 0$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}m + n > 0$. However, since $x < \frac{1}{2}$ is the solution, the boundary condition should make the inequality equal to zero, so $\frac{1}{2}m + n = 0$. ## Step 4: Solving for the relationship between $m$ and $n$ From the equation $\frac{1}{2}m + n = 0$, we can solve for $n$ in terms of $m$.

Simplifying, we get $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$. ## Step 6: Solving the second inequality We need to solve the inequality $-\frac{1}{2}mx - m < 0$. First, let's divide the entire inequality by $-1$, remembering to flip the inequality sign: $\frac{1}{2}mx + m > 0$. Since $m$ is a common factor, we can factor it out: $m(\frac{1}{2}x + 1) > 0$. For this inequality to hold true, either both $m > 0$ and $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 > 0$, or both $m < 0$ and $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 < 0$. ## Step 7: Finding the solution to the second inequality Since $m$ and $n$ are constants and we know from the first inequality that $n = -\frac{1}{2}m$, we focus on the condition that makes $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 > 0$ since $m > 0$ would be consistent with the need for $mx + n > 0$ when $x < \frac{1}{2}$. Solving $\frac{1}{2}x + 1 > 0$ gives $\frac{1}{2}x > -1$, and thus $x > -2$. Therefore, the solution set to $nx - m < 0$ is $x > -2$.

This step should be dividing by $-\frac{1}{2}$ and keeping the inequality sign the same, resulting in $mx + 2m > 0$. Then, factoring out $m$ gives $m(x + 2) > 0$. For this inequality to hold true, either $m > 0$ and $x + 2 > 0$, or $m < 0$ and $x + 2 < 0$.

\[ x^2 - 4x - 5 > 0 \]
Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left side of the inequality:
\[ (x - 5)(x + 1) > 0 \]
For the product of two terms to be greater than zero, both terms must be greater than zero, or both must be less than zero. Therefore, we divide our analysis into two cases:

1. Both terms are positive:
   For the first term $(x-5) > 0$, the solution is $x > 5$.

The critical points $x = -1$ and $x = 5$ divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 5)$, and $(5, \infty)$.

## Step 6: Test a value from each interval in the original inequality
For $x < -1$, let's test $x = -2$: $(-2)^2 - 4(-2) - 5 = 4 + 8 - 5 = 7 > 0$. For $-1 < x < 5$, let's test $x = 0$: $0^2 - 4(0) - 5 = -5 < 0$. For $x > 5$, let's test $x = 6$: $6^2 - 4(6) - 5 = 36 - 24 - 5 = 7 > 0$.

Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left side of the inequality:

For the product of two terms to be greater than zero, both terms must be greater than zero, or both must be less than zero. Therefore, we divide our analysis into two cases:

   For the first term $(x-5) > 0$, the solution is $x > 5$.
   For the second term $(x+1) > 0$, the solution is $x > -1$. 
   The common solution is the intersection of these two, which is $x > 5$.

   For the first term $(x-5) < 0$, the solution is $x < 5$.
   For the second term $(x+1) < 0$, the solution is $x < -1$.

To solve the inequality, we first need to move all terms to one side to set it to 0. So, we subtract $3x$ from both sides to get $x^2 - 4x - 5 > 0$.

## Step 3: Factor the quadratic equation if possible
The quadratic expression $x^2 - 4x - 5$ can be factored into $(x - 5)(x + 1)$.

## Step 4: Solve the inequality
To solve $(x - 5)(x + 1) > 0$, we look for where the expression is positive. This happens when both factors are negative or both are positive.

## Step 5: Find the intervals where the inequality holds true
Both factors are negative in the interval $-1 < x < 5$. Both factors are positive when $x < -1$ or $x > 5$. However, since we are looking for $(x - 5)(x + 1) > 0$, the solution intervals are $x < -1$ or $x > 5$.

The solution set in interval notation is $(-\infty, -1) \cup (5, \infty)$.

\[ x^2 - x - 5 - 3x > 0 \]
Simplifying the inequality, we have:
\[ x^2 - 4x - 5 > 0 \]
Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left side of the inequality:
\[ (x - 5)(x + 1) > 0 \]
For the product of two terms to be greater than zero, both terms must be greater than zero, or both must be less than zero. Therefore, we divide our analysis into two cases:

1. Both terms are positive:
   For the first term $(x-5) > 0$, the solution is $x > 5$.
   For the second term $(x+1) > 0$, the solution is $x > -1$. 
   The common solution is the intersection of these two, which is $x > 5$.

2. Both terms are negative:
   For the first term $(x-5) < 0$, the solution is $x < 5$.
   For the second term $(x+1) < 0$, the solution is $x < -1$.

Calculate $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify each term:

   - $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$, because $27 = 3^3$ and $\sqrt{3^3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, because $\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{3^{-1}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{3}$ remains as is.

2. Combine the terms:

   - $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{3}\sqrt{3}$.
   - This simplifies to $\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

   - $\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$, because $32 = 2^5$ and $\sqrt{2^5} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
   - $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$, because $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$ and $\sqrt{2 \cdot 3^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

2. Combine the terms in the numerator and simplify the fraction:

   - $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
   - Since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1$, this simplifies to $7$.

Calculate $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify each term:

   - $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$, because $27 = 3^3$ and $\sqrt{3^3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, because $\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{3^{-1}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{3}$ remains as is.

2. Combine the terms:

   - $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{3}\sqrt{3}$.
   - This simplifies to $\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

### Problem 2:

Calculate $\frac{\sqrt{32}+\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}-8$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify the numerator:

   - $\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$, because $32 = 2^5$ and $\sqrt{2^5} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
   - $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$, because $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$ and $\sqrt{2 \cdot 3^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

2. Combine the terms in the numerator and simplify the fraction:

   - $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
   - Since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1$, this simplifies to $7$.

3. Subtract 8 from the simplified fraction:

   - $7 - 8 = -1$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{-1}$.",1,"## Step 1: First, let's solve the square roots in the first expression given: $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.
$\sqrt{27}$ can be simplified as $\sqrt{9 \times 3}$, which equals $3\sqrt{3}$ because $\sqrt{9} = 3$. $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$ can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$, resulting in $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. So, the expression becomes $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3}$.

## Step 2: Next, let's simplify the first expression further by combining like terms.
We have $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3}$. This can be rewritten as $3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

$\sqrt{32}$ can be simplified as $\sqrt{16 \times 2}$, which equals $4\sqrt{2}$ because $\sqrt{16} = 4$. $\sqrt{18}$ can be simplified as $\sqrt{9 \times 2}$, which equals $3\sqrt{2}$ because $\sqrt{9} = 3$. So, the expression becomes $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8$.

## Step 4: Simplify the second expression further by combining like terms in the numerator and then dividing by $\sqrt{2}$.
Combining $4\sqrt{2}$ and $3\sqrt{2}$ gives $7\sqrt{2}$. Dividing by $\sqrt{2}$, we get $\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$, which simplifies to $7$ because $\sqrt{2}$ cancels out. So, the expression becomes $7 - 8$.

$7 - 8 = -1$.

Calculate $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify each term:

   - $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$, because $27 = 3^3$ and $\sqrt{3^3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, because $\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{3^{-1}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{3}$ remains as is.

2. Combine the terms:

   - $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{3}\sqrt{3}$.
   - This simplifies to $\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

### Problem 2:

Calculate $\frac{\sqrt{32}+\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}-8$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify the numerator:

   - $\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$, because $32 = 2^5$ and $\sqrt{2^5} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
   - $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$, because $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$ and $\sqrt{2 \cdot 3^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

2. Combine the terms in the numerator and simplify the fraction:

   - $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
   - Since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1$, this simplifies to $7$.

3. Subtract 8 from the simplified fraction:

   - $7 - 8 = -1$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{-1}$.",4,"## Step 1: First, let's simplify each radical in the given expressions step by step.
For the first expression: $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$. We can simplify $\sqrt{27}$ as $\sqrt{9 \times 3}$, which equals $3\sqrt{3}$ because $\sqrt{9} = 3$. The term $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$, resulting in $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 2: Next, let's substitute the simplified radicals back into the first expression and perform the operations.
So, the first expression becomes $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3}$. Combining like terms, we have $3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. This simplifies to $4\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 3: Now, let's find a common denominator to add and subtract the terms in the first expression.
To combine $4\sqrt{3}$ and $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, we express $4\sqrt{3}$ as $\frac{12\sqrt{3}}{3}$, resulting in $\frac{12\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 4: Moving on to the second expression: $\frac{\sqrt{32}+\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}-8$.
We can simplify $\sqrt{32}$ as $\sqrt{16 \times 2}$, which equals $4\sqrt{2}$ because $\sqrt{16} = 4$. Similarly, $\sqrt{18}$ simplifies to $\sqrt{9 \times 2}$, which equals $3\sqrt{2}$ because $\sqrt{9} = 3$.

## Step 5: Substitute the simplified radicals back into the second expression and perform the operations.
The expression becomes $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8$. Combining like terms in the numerator, we get $\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8$. The $\sqrt{2}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving us with $7 - 8$.

1. We first transform the given function for simplicity:
\[ y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x \]

2. By using trigonometric identities, we can express this as a single sine function:
\[ y=2\sin\left(x+\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \]

3. For a sine function, the interval where it's decreasing is between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, considering the periodic nature of sine. Therefore, we set the inside of the sine function within these bounds:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi \leqslant x+\frac{\pi}{3} \leqslant \frac{3\pi}{2}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

4. Solving for $x$ in the inequality:
\[ \frac{\pi}{6}+2k\pi \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{7\pi}{6}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

5. Given $x\in \left[0,2\pi \right]$, we find the intersection of this domain with the solution from step 4. This step ensures that we only consider the valid $x$ values within the given interval.

Therefore, the strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$ is $\boxed{\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]}$.",0,"## Step 1: Identify the function and interval
The function given is $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ on the interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$.

## Step 2: Determine the derivative of the function
To find the intervals where the function is strictly decreasing, we need to find the derivative of the function. The derivative $y'$ of $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ is $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x$.

## Step 3: Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points
To find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero: $\cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x = 0$. This can be rewritten as $\cos x = \sqrt{3} \sin x$.

## Step 4: Solve for x
Dividing both sides by $\cos x$ (assuming $\cos x \neq 0$), we get $1 = \sqrt{3} \tan x$. Thus, $\tan x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. This implies $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ or $x = \frac{7\pi}{6}$ in the interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$ because $\tan x$ is positive in the first and third quadrants.

## Step 5: Determine the sign of the derivative in the intervals defined by the critical points

## Step 6: Analyze the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = 0$, we find $y' = 1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = 1 > 0$. Thus, the function is increasing in this interval.

## Step 7: Analyze the interval $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = \pi$, we find $y' = -1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = -1 < 0$. Thus, the function is decreasing in this interval.

## Step 8: Analyze the interval $\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$, we find $y' = -\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 1 > 0$. Thus, the function is increasing in this interval.

## Step 6: Analyze the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = 0$, we find $y' = \cos(0) - \sqrt{3} \sin(0) = 1 > 0$. Therefore, the function is increasing in this interval.

## Step 8: Analyze the interval $\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$, we find $y' = \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) - \sqrt{3} \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = 0 - \sqrt{3}(-1) = \sqrt{3} > 0$. Therefore, the function is increasing in this interval.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it fails to consider the periodic nature of the sine function and the given interval. In Step 7, the solution should intersect the interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$ with the solution from Step 6, which is $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$. This intersection is indeed $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$, not $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{4\pi}{3}\right)$. The candidate solution incorrectly assumes that the interval ends at $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ without considering the periodicity and the given interval's upper bound.",False,1,"## Step 1: Identify the given function and interval The given function is $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3}\cos x$, and the interval is $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$. ## Step 2: Determine the condition for a function to be strictly decreasing For a function to be strictly decreasing, its derivative must be less than zero. ## Step 3: Find the derivative of the given function The derivative of $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3}\cos x$ with respect to $x$ is $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x$. ## Step 4: Set the derivative less than zero to find the intervals where the function is decreasing $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$. ## Step 5: Solve the inequality To solve $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$, we can divide both sides by $\cos x$ (when $\cos x \neq 0$) to get $1 - \sqrt{3}\tan x < 0$, which simplifies to $\tan x > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. However, a more general approach involves using the identity that $A\cos x + B\sin x = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\cos(x - \alpha)$, where $\alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)$. For our case, this means $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x = \sqrt{1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2}\cos(x - \alpha)$, where $\alpha = \arctan(-\sqrt{3})$. This simplifies to $2\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) < 0$ because $\arctan(-\sqrt{3}) = -\frac{\pi}{3}$, and we use the identity $\cos(-x) = \cos(x)$. ## Step 6: Solve $2\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) < 0$ The inequality $2\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) < 0$ simplifies to"," $\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) < 0$. $\cos(\theta) < 0$ when $\theta$ is in the second or third quadrant, which corresponds to $\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{3\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\frac{\pi}{2} < x + \frac{\pi}{3} < \frac{3\pi}{2}$. Subtracting $\frac{\pi}{3}$ from all parts gives $\frac{\pi}{6} < x < \frac{7\pi}{6}$. However, considering the original interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$ and the periodic nature of $\cos(x)$, we should focus on where the condition is met within this interval. ## Step 7: Conclude the strict decreasing interval Based on the inequality solution, the strict decreasing interval of the function $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3}\cos x$ within $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$ is $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$, considering the continuous nature of the trigonometric functions involved and ensuring we stay within the bounds of the given interval.

The candidate solution is almost correct, but it misses a crucial detail in the final answer.

1. We first transform the given function for simplicity:
\[ y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x \]

2. By using trigonometric identities, we can express this as a single sine function:
\[ y=2\sin\left(x+\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \]

3. For a sine function, the interval where it's decreasing is between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, considering the periodic nature of sine. Therefore, we set the inside of the sine function within these bounds:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi \leqslant x+\frac{\pi}{3} \leqslant \frac{3\pi}{2}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

4. Solving for $x$ in the inequality:
\[ \frac{\pi}{6}+2k\pi \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{7\pi}{6}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

\[ \left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right] \]

Therefore, the strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$ is $\boxed{\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]}$.",3,"## Step 1: Identify the function and interval given
The function given is $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ and the interval is $\left[0,2\pi \right]$.

## Step 2: Recall the condition for a function to be strictly decreasing
A function $y = f(x)$ is strictly decreasing on an interval if for any two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the interval, $x_1 < x_2$ implies $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.

## Step 3: Find the derivative of the given function to analyze its behavior
To determine where the function is strictly decreasing, we find its derivative. The derivative $y'$ of $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ is $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x$.

## Step 4: Set the derivative less than zero to find intervals where the function is decreasing
To find where the function is decreasing, we set $y' < 0$ and solve for $x$. Thus, $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$.

## Step 5: Solve the inequality $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$
This can be rewritten as $\tan x > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. We know that $\tan x > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ when $x$ is in the first quadrant and $x > \frac{\pi}{6}$, and in the third quadrant, $x > \pi + \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{7\pi}{6}$, considering the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$.

But since we're looking for where the function is strictly decreasing, we should consider where the derivative is negative, which actually simplifies to solving $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$. This implies we're interested in where the combination of sine and cosine functions with the given coefficients results in a negative slope.

## Step 7: Correct the analysis based on the nature of sine and cosine functions and their combination
The error in the previous steps came from simplifying the condition for the function to be decreasing without properly accounting for the combination of sine and cosine in the derivative. We need to consider the signs of $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ and how they combine with their coefficients to determine the intervals where the derivative is negative.

## Step 8: Finalize the interval based on the corrected understanding of the derivative's sign
Given $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x$, to be strictly decreasing, $y'$ must be less than 0. This involves understanding the behavior of the derivative across the given interval and identifying where it indeed becomes negative, indicating the function's decrease.

This is more accurately found by considering the phases where the sine and cosine components contribute to a negative derivative, taking into account the coefficients. The derivative will be negative when $\cos x < \sqrt{3}\sin x$, considering the signs of sine and cosine in different quadrants. The function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ can be viewed as a single sinusoidal function with a phase shift. For it to be decreasing, the phase shift and the coefficients indicate it decreases after its peak, which corresponds to where its derivative becomes negative. To solve $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$ directly, divide both sides by $\cos x$ (noting $\cos x > 0$ in the first and fourth quadrants), giving $\tan x > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. But the accurate approach should involve identifying where the linear combination of sine and cosine with coefficients results in a negative derivative, indicating a decrease. The phase shift for the function $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3}\cos x$ can be found by rewriting it in the form $y = A\sin(Bx + C)$, but since we're focusing on the decreasing interval based on its derivative, we directly analyze the sign of the derivative. Given the derivative $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x$, to find where it's negative, consider the unit circle and the signs of sine and cosine in each quadrant.

The roots of $y' = 0$ are given by $\cos x = \sqrt{3}\sin x$, or $\tan x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, which are $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and $x = \frac{7\pi}{6}$ in the interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it identifies an incorrect interval as the strict decreasing interval for the given function. The solution starts off well by identifying the function and interval, and recalling the definition of a strictly decreasing function. It then proceeds to find the derivative, which is a crucial step in identifying the decreasing interval. However, the subsequent steps and reasoning seem to be flawed.

In Step 4, the candidate solution sets the derivative less than zero, which is a correct approach to find the decreasing interval. However, the inequality $\cos x - \sqrt{3}\sin x < 0$ is not correctly solved in Step 5. The solution states that this inequality can be rewritten as $\tan x > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, but this is not accurate. The correct approach would be to divide both sides by $\cos x$ (assuming $\cos x > 0$), which would give $\tan x < \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, not greater. This is a critical mistake that leads to an incorrect interval in the end.

The solution then tries to correct itself by stating that the accurate approach should involve identifying where the linear combination of sine and cosine with coefficients results in a negative derivative. However, it does not fully correct the previous mistake and instead continues with an incomplete analysis. It mentions the phase shift and the coefficients but does not explicitly calculate or identify the correct interval.

Choosing a test point, say $x = \pi$, we find $y' = -1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = -1 < 0$. Thus, the function is decreasing in this interval.

From steps 5, 6, and 7, the function is decreasing in the intervals $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$ and $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$. However, we are looking for the strict decreasing interval within $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$, which means we consider where the function is strictly decreasing without including points where the derivative is zero. Both intervals where the function decreases are valid, but the question likely seeks a single interval or the understanding that the function decreases after the first critical point until the end of the interval given.

The candidate solution is mostly correct, but it contains a minor error in Step 8. The solution states that the function is decreasing in the intervals $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$ and $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$, which is true. However, it then concludes that the strict decreasing interval is $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$, implying that the interval $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$ is not considered. This is incorrect, as the function is also strictly decreasing in the interval $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$, and this should be included in the final answer. The correct strict decreasing interval should be the union of these two intervals, which is $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$.",False,0,"## Step 1: Identify the given function and interval The given function is $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$, and the interval is $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$. ## Step 2: Differentiate the function to find the critical points To find the strict decreasing interval, we need to differentiate the function. The derivative of $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ is $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x$. ## Step 3: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x To find the critical points, we set $y' = 0$. Thus, $\cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x = 0$. Rearranging, we get $\cos x = \sqrt{3} \sin x$, or $\tan x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Solving for $x$ in the given interval, we find $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and $x = \frac{7\pi}{6}$. ## Step 4: Determine the sign of the derivative in the intervals defined by the critical points We need to check the sign of $y'$ in the intervals $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right]$, $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$, and $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$ to determine where the function is decreasing. ## Step 5: Analyze the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right]$ Choosing a test point, say $x = 0$, we find $y' = 1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = 1 > 0$.

However, we should also check near $2\pi$ for completeness. For $x$ near $2\pi$, $y'$ is positive, indicating the function starts increasing again before $2\pi$. Thus, the function is decreasing up to a point before $2\pi$. ## Step 8: Determine the strict decreasing interval Based on the analysis, the function is strictly decreasing in the interval $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$.

245856,"The strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$ is ____.","To analyze the strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$, we follow these steps:

1. We first transform the given function for simplicity:
\[ y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x \]

2. By using trigonometric identities, we can express this as a single sine function:
\[ y=2\sin\left(x+\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \]

3. For a sine function, the interval where it's decreasing is between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, considering the periodic nature of sine. Therefore, we set the inside of the sine function within these bounds:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi \leqslant x+\frac{\pi}{3} \leqslant \frac{3\pi}{2}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

4. Solving for $x$ in the inequality:
\[ \frac{\pi}{6}+2k\pi \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{7\pi}{6}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

5. Given $x\in \left[0,2\pi \right]$, we find the intersection of this domain with the solution from step 4. This step ensures that we only consider the valid $x$ values within the given interval.

6. By analyzing the bounds and the periodic nature of the sine function, we conclude that for $k=0$ (since $x$ is within $[0, 2\pi]$), the decreasing interval is:
\[ \left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right] \]

Therefore, the strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$ is $\boxed{\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]}$.",4,"## Step 1: Identify the given function and interval
The given function is $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$, and the interval is $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$.

## Step 2: Differentiate the function to find the critical points
To find the strict decreasing interval, we need to differentiate the function. The derivative of $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ is $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x$.

## Step 3: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x
To find the critical points, we set $y' = 0$. Thus, $\cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x = 0$. Rearranging, we get $\cos x = \sqrt{3} \sin x$, or $\tan x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Solving for $x$ in the given interval, we find $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and $x = \frac{7\pi}{6}$.

## Step 4: Determine the sign of the derivative in the intervals defined by the critical points
We need to check the sign of $y'$ in the intervals $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right]$, $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$, and $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$ to determine where the function is decreasing.

## Step 5: Analyze the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right]$
Choosing a test point, say $x = 0$, we find $y' = 1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = 1 > 0$. Thus, the function is increasing in this interval.

## Step 6: Analyze the interval $\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]$
Choosing a test point, say $x = \pi$, we find $y' = -1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = -1 < 0$. Thus, the function is decreasing in this interval.

## Step 7: Analyze the interval $\left[\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$
Choosing a test point, say $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$, we find $y' = -\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -2 < 0$. Thus, the function is also decreasing in this interval.

Therefore, we identify the interval where the function starts decreasing after $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and continues to decrease until $x = \frac{7\pi}{6}$, and also consider the behavior until $2\pi$. Given the analysis, we note the decreasing behavior but must identify the specific interval asked for in the problem statement.
