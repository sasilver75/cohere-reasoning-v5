Hence, the correct option is $\boxed{D}$.",0,"## Step 1: Understanding the constraints
The principal has 4 students to recommend and there are 3 universities to choose from. Each university can accept at most 2 recommended students.

## Step 2: Breaking down the problem into cases
To calculate the total number of recommendation plans, we need to consider different scenarios based on how many students are recommended to each university.

## Step 3: Calculating the number of plans for each case
We can break down the problem into the following cases:
- All 4 students are recommended to the same university (not possible since each university can accept at most 2 students).
- 3 students are recommended to one university and 1 student to another (not possible since the first university can only accept 2 students).
- 2 students are recommended to one university and 2 students to another.
- 2 students are recommended to one university and 1 student each to the other two universities.

## Step 4: Calculating plans for 2 students to one university and 2 to another
First, select the university that gets 2 students, which can be done in 3 ways. Then, choose 2 students out of 4 to go to that university, which can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. Finally, choose 2 out of the remaining 2 students for the second university, which can be done in C(2,2) = 1 way. The last university gets no students. This results in 3 * 6 * 1 = 18 plans.

## Step 5: Calculating plans for 2 students to one university and 1 student each to the other two
Select the university that gets 2 students, which can be done in 3 ways. Then, choose 2 students out of 4 to go to that university, which can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. The remaining 2 students can be distributed to the other 2 universities in 2 ways (since the order in which they go to the universities matters for counting distinct plans). This results in 3 * 6 * 2 = 36 plans.

## Step 6: Summing up all possible plans
Adding the plans from step 4 and step 5 gives us the total number of recommendation plans the principal can make.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$","The final answer of the ground truth solution is D: 54.

The final answer of the candidate solution is 36.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it only considers the cases where 2 students are recommended to one university and the remaining students are distributed among the other two universities. It fails to account for the scenario where 1 student is recommended to each university, which is a valid option as each university can accept up to 2 students.

Hence, the correct option is $\boxed{D}$.",1,"## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem.
The high school can recommend 4 students to three different universities, with each university able to accept at most 2 recommended students.

## Step 2: Enumerate the possibilities for distributing the 4 students across the 3 universities.
Given the constraint that each university can accept at most 2 students, the distribution possibilities are limited. The combinations can be as follows:
- (2, 2, 0): 2 students to one university, 2 to another, and none to the third. This can be rearranged in 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 6 ways since the universities are distinct, but the number of students each gets is the same.
- (2, 1, 1): 2 students to one university, 1 to another, and 1 to the last. This can be rearranged in 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 6 ways for the same reason.
These are the only distributions possible under the given constraints.

## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select students for each distribution scenario.
For the (2, 2, 0) scenario, we need to select 2 students out of 4 for the first university, and then 2 out of the remaining 2 for the second university. The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 6 * 1 = 6.
For the (2, 1, 1) scenario, we need to select 2 students out of 4 for the first university, then 1 out of the remaining 2 for the second university, and the last student automatically goes to the third university. The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 6 * 2 * 1 = 12.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of recommendation plans by combining the results from Step 2 and Step 3.
For (2, 2, 0), considering the 6 arrangements of universities, we have 6 * 6 = 36 ways.
For (2, 1, 1), considering the 6 arrangements of universities, we have 6 * 12 = 72 ways.
However, we need to consider the correct calculation based on the distinct arrangements of students across universities, taking into account the specific distribution scenarios correctly.

## Step 5: Correct the approach based on the actual question requirements.
We should directly consider how many ways the principal can recommend 4 students to 3 universities with the given constraints, focusing on the selection and arrangement of students rather than the distribution patterns alone.

## Step 6: Recalculate based on the correct understanding of the problem.
The correct approach involves considering each student's possible university assignments directly:
- Each of the 4 students can be recommended to any of the 3 universities, but with the constraint that no more than 2 students can be recommended to the same university.

## Step 7: Apply the correct method for calculating the number of recommendation plans.
Considering each student's options and the constraint, we can approach this as a problem of permutations with constraints. However, the direct calculation of specific distributions might be complex due to the overlapping possibilities and the need to consider each student's assignment individually.

## Step 8: Simplify the calculation by considering the problem's requirements directly.
Given the complexity of directly calculating each distribution, we should reconsider the basic principle of how many choices the principal has for each student and how these choices are constrained by the university's acceptance limit.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$","The final answer of the ground truth solution is D, which corresponds to 54.

The final answer of the candidate solution is 36.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it does not consider all the possible arrangements of students across universities. In Step 2, the solution only considers two distribution scenarios: (2, 2, 0) and (2, 1, 1). However, there are other valid distributions, such as (1, 1, 2), which the ground truth solution correctly identifies. This oversight leads to an incorrect calculation in Step 4, where the total number of recommendation plans is calculated as 36 + 72 = 108, which is not the correct answer.

The candidate solution also seems to confuse the concept of arrangements and combinations in Step 3. For the (2, 2, 0) scenario, the solution calculates the number of ways as C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 6 * 1 = 6. However, this calculation is incorrect because it treats the universities as indistinguishable, which is not the case. The correct calculation should consider the arrangements of universities, leading to 3! / (1! * 1! * 1!) = 6 ways, as the ground truth solution does.",False

A: $x \lt -2$

B: $x \lt 2$

C: $x \gt -2$

D: $x \gt 2$","Given that the solution to $mx+n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can analyze the inequality step by step:

1. For $mx+n > 0$ to have a solution of $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it implies that when $x$ is substituted with $\frac{1}{2}$, the inequality $mx+n$ should switch from being positive to non-positive. This indicates that $m$ must be negative, i.e., $m < 0$, because as $x$ increases, $mx$ decreases if $m$ is negative.

2. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality and setting it to equality gives us $m\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+n = 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = -\frac{m}{2}$. Since $m < 0$, it follows that $n > 0$.

3. The relationship $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$ comes from rearranging the equation $n = -\frac{m}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

4. Now, looking at the inequality $nx-m < 0$, we want to find its solution set. We can rewrite this inequality as $x < \frac{m}{n}$ by adding $m$ to both sides and then dividing by $n$, assuming $n > 0$ (which we have established).

5. Substituting $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$ into $\frac{m}{n}$ gives us $\frac{m}{n} = -2$. This is because flipping the fraction $\frac{n}{m}$ to $\frac{m}{n}$ is equivalent to taking the reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $-2$.

6. Therefore, the solution to $nx-m < 0$ is $x < -2$.

Hence, the correct answer is $\boxed{A}$.",0,"## Step 1: Understanding the first inequality
The given inequality is $mx + n > 0$, and its solution is $x < \frac{1}{2}$. This implies that the expression $mx + n$ is positive for all values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 2: Finding the relation between $m$ and $n$
To find the relation between $m$ and $n$, we can use the boundary value of $x$, which is $\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality $mx + n > 0$ gives us $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n > 0$. Simplifying this, we get $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$.

## Step 3: Determining the sign of $m$
Since the solution to the inequality $mx + n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it means that as $x$ decreases (becomes more negative), $mx + n$ remains positive. This can only happen if $m$ is negative, because then $mx$ becomes positive as $x$ becomes negative, contributing to the overall positivity of $mx + n$.

## Step 4: Analyzing the second inequality
The second inequality is $nx - m < 0$. Given that $m$ is negative, $-m$ is positive. For $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ must be less than $m$ (a negative value), implying $nx < 0$ since $m$ is negative.

## Step 5: Determining the solution set of the second inequality
Since $m$ is negative, for $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ must also be negative to satisfy the inequality. Knowing $m$ is negative and considering $nx < m$, if $n$ is positive, $x$ must be negative to make $nx$ negative. However, we need to determine the relation between $n$ and $m$ more precisely to solve $nx - m < 0$.

## Step 6: Using the boundary condition to relate $m$ and $n$
From Step 2, we have $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$. Since $m$ is negative, $n$ must be positive to satisfy this inequality. Thus, $n > -\frac{m}{2}$.

## Step 7: Solving $nx - m < 0$
Given $n > 0$ (from Step 6, as $n$ must be positive to satisfy $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$ with $m$ being negative), $x$ must be such that $nx < m$. Since $m$ is negative, $nx$ must also be negative, implying $x < 0$.

## Step 8: Finding the exact bound for $x$
To find the exact bound for $x$, we use the fact that $m$ and $n$ are related through the inequality $\frac{m}{2} + n > 0$. However, without a specific value for $m$ or $n$, we look at the condition given by the inequality $nx - m < 0$. This implies $nx < m$, and since $m$ is negative, $nx$ must also be negative. Given $n$ is positive, $x$ must be negative.

## Step 9: Relating the boundary of $x$ in the second inequality to the options
Considering $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for the first inequality and knowing $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, we need to find how $x$ relates to $-\frac{m}{n}$ in the inequality $nx - m < 0$. The boundary condition for $x$ in this case would be when $nx = m$, but since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, $x$ would be negative.

## Step 10: Finalizing the solution set
Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, and considering the inequality $nx - m < 0$, for $nx$ to be less than $m$ (a negative value), $x$ must be such that $nx$ is negative, implying $x$ is negative since $n$ is positive. The exact bound for $x$ would depend on the values of $m$ and $n$, but given the options and understanding that $x$ must be negative, we can proceed to determine the most appropriate answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$","The final answer of the ground truth solution is **A**.

The final answer of the candidate solution is **C**.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it fails to correctly determine the solution set for the inequality $nx - m < 0$. In Step 4, the solution correctly identifies that $nx < 0$ is required for the inequality to hold. However, in Step 5, it does not accurately conclude that $x < -\frac{m}{n}$ is the solution set. Instead, it focuses on the sign of $x$ without establishing the exact bound.

The key error lies in Step 7, where the solution states that $x < 0$ is the solution set. This is not precise enough, as it does not consider the relationship between $m$ and $n$. In fact, the correct solution set is $x < -\frac{m}{n}$, which, as shown in the ground truth solution, simplifies to $x < -2$ given the relationship between $m$ and $n$.

The candidate solution's reasoning is on the right track, but it misses the crucial step of relating $m$ and $n$ to find the exact bound for $x$. As a result, it incorrectly concludes that the solution set is $x < 0$, leading to the wrong final answer.",False

A: $x \lt -2$

B: $x \lt 2$

C: $x \gt -2$

D: $x \gt 2$","Given that the solution to $mx+n > 0$ is $x < \frac{1}{2}$, we can analyze the inequality step by step:

1. For $mx+n > 0$ to have a solution of $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it implies that when $x$ is substituted with $\frac{1}{2}$, the inequality $mx+n$ should switch from being positive to non-positive.

2. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{2}$ into the inequality and setting it to equality gives us $m\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+n = 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = -\frac{m}{2}$. Since $m < 0$, it follows that $n > 0$.

3. The relationship $-\frac{n}{m} = \frac{1}{2}$ comes from rearranging the equation $n = -\frac{m}{2}$, which implies $\frac{n}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

6. Therefore, the solution to $nx-m < 0$ is $x < -2$.

Hence, the correct answer is $\boxed{A}$.",1,"## Step 1: Understand the given inequality and its solution
The given inequality is $mx + n > 0$, and its solution is $x < \frac{1}{2}$. This implies that the expression $mx + n$ is positive for all values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 2: Determine the sign of $m$ and $n$ based on the given solution
For $mx + n > 0$ when $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it means that as $x$ approaches negative infinity, $mx + n$ remains positive. This can only happen if $m$ is negative because a negative $m$ would make $mx$ positive as $x$ becomes more negative, ensuring $mx + n$ stays positive regardless of the value of $n$. However, since we also know the solution is bounded by $x < \frac{1}{2}$, it suggests that $n$ must be positive to ensure the inequality holds true for positive values of $x$ less than $\frac{1}{2}$.

## Step 3: Analyze the inequality $nx - m < 0$
Given that $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, we want to find when $nx - m < 0$. Since $n$ is positive, $nx$ will be negative for $x < 0$ and positive for $x > 0$. Given that $m$ is negative, subtracting a negative $m$ from $nx$ means we are essentially adding a positive value to $nx$. For $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ must be negative enough to overcome the addition of $-m$ (which is equivalent to adding a positive value since $m$ is negative).

## Step 4: Solve $nx - m < 0$ considering the signs of $m$ and $n$
Since $n > 0$ and $m < 0$, for $nx - m < 0$, $nx$ needs to be less than $m$ (a negative value) to ensure the overall expression is less than zero. Given that $m$ is a constant negative value, $n$ being positive means that $x$ must be sufficiently negative to make $nx$ small enough (more negative) to be less than $m$.

## Step 5: Determine the exact boundary for $x$
To find the boundary, set $nx - m = 0$ and solve for $x$. This gives $nx = m$, and thus $x = \frac{m}{n}$. Since $m$ is negative and $n$ is positive, $\frac{m}{n}$ will be negative.

## Step 6: Recall the original inequality solution to inform about $m$ and $n$
The solution $x < \frac{1}{2}$ for $mx + n > 0$ implies that when $x = \frac{1}{2}$, $m(\frac{1}{2}) + n = 0$ because it's the boundary condition. This gives $\frac{m}{2} + n = 0$, or $m = -2n$.

## Step 7: Solve for the boundary in $nx - m < 0$ using $m = -2n$
Substitute $m = -2n$ into $x = \frac{m}{n}$ to find the boundary for $nx - m < 0$. This gives $x = \frac{-2n}{n} = -2$.

## Step 8: Determine the solution set based on the boundary
Since $x$ must be such that $nx - m < 0$, and knowing $x = -2$ is the boundary where $nx - m = 0$, for $nx - m$ to be less than zero, $x$ must be greater than $-2$ because $n$ is positive and $m$ is negative.

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$","The final answer provided in the ground truth solution is **A**. This is because the solution to the inequality $nx - m < 0$ is $x < -2$, as determined through a series of logical steps.

However, the candidate solution provides a different final answer, **C**. This is incorrect, and the reasoning goes awry in several steps:

- In Step 3, the candidate solution correctly identifies that $nx - m < 0$ requires $nx$ to be negative enough to overcome the addition of $-m$. However, it then incorrectly concludes that $nx$ must be less than $m$ to ensure the expression is less than zero. This is not necessarily true, as the key is for $nx$ to be negative, not necessarily less than $m$.

- In Step 5, the candidate solution finds the boundary for $x$ by setting $nx - m = 0$, which is correct. However, it then incorrectly substitutes $m = -2n$ (derived from the original inequality's solution) into $x = \frac{m}{n}$. This substitution is not valid because it assumes a direct relationship between the two inequalities, which is not necessarily the case.

- In Step 7, the candidate solution substitutes $m = -2n$ into the boundary equation, which, as mentioned earlier, is not a valid substitution. This leads to an incorrect boundary value of $x = -2$.

\[ x^2 - x - 5 - 3x > 0 \]
Simplifying the inequality, we have:
\[ x^2 - 4x - 5 > 0 \]
Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left side of the inequality:
\[ (x - 5)(x + 1) > 0 \]
For the product of two terms to be greater than zero, both terms must be greater than zero, or both must be less than zero. Therefore, we divide our analysis into two cases:

1. Both terms are positive:
   For the first term $(x-5) > 0$, the solution is $x > 5$.

\[ \boxed{\{x | x > 5 \text{ or } x < -1\}} \]",0,"## Step 1: Rearrange the inequality to set it to 0
First, we need to move all terms to one side of the inequality to set it in relation to zero. So, we subtract $3x$ from both sides of the inequality $x^2 - x - 5 > 3x$ to get $x^2 - 4x - 5 > 0$.

## Step 2: Factor the quadratic equation if possible
The quadratic equation $x^2 - 4x - 5$ can be factored into $(x - 5)(x + 1)$, so the inequality becomes $(x - 5)(x + 1) > 0$.

## Step 3: Find the critical points
To find the intervals where the inequality is true, we first identify the critical points where $(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us $x = 5$ and $x = -1$.

## Step 4: Test the intervals
We must test the intervals defined by these points: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 5)$, and $(5, \infty)$ to see where the inequality $(x - 5)(x + 1) > 0$ holds true. We pick a test point from each interval: for $(-\infty, -1)$, let's use $x = -2$; for $(-1, 5)$, $x = 0$; and for $(5, \infty)$, $x = 6$.

## Step 5: Evaluate the test points
For $x = -2$: $(-2 - 5)(-2 + 1) = (-7)(-1) = 7 > 0$, so the inequality is true in the interval $(-\infty, -1)$.
For $x = 0$: $(0 - 5)(0 + 1) = (-5)(1) = -5 < 0$, so the inequality is not true in the interval $(-1, 5)$.
For $x = 6$: $(6 - 5)(6 + 1) = (1)(7) = 7 > 0$, so the inequality is true in the interval $(5, \infty)$.

## Step 6: Determine the solution set
The inequality is satisfied for $x$ in the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$ and $(5, \infty)$. Therefore, the solution set in interval notation is $(-\infty, -1) \cup (5, \infty)$.

The critical points $x = -1$ and $x = 5$ divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 5)$, and $(5, \infty)$.

Calculate $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify each term:

   - $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$, because $27 = 3^3$ and $\sqrt{3^3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, because $\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{3^{-1}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{3}$ remains as is.

2. Combine the terms:

   - $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{3}\sqrt{3}$.
   - This simplifies to $\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

### Problem 2:

Calculate $\frac{\sqrt{32}+\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}-8$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify the numerator:

   - $\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$, because $32 = 2^5$ and $\sqrt{2^5} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
   - $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$, because $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$ and $\sqrt{2 \cdot 3^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

2. Combine the terms in the numerator and simplify the fraction:

   - $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
   - Since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1$, this simplifies to $7$.

3. Subtract 8 from the simplified fraction:

   - $7 - 8 = -1$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{-1}$.",0,"## Step 1: First, let's simplify the square roots in the given expressions.
For the first expression: $\sqrt{27} = \sqrt{9 \times 3} = 3\sqrt{3}$, and $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. For the second expression: $\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \times 2} = 4\sqrt{2}$, and $\sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \times 2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

## Step 2: Now, let's substitute the simplified square roots back into the expressions.
First expression: $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \sqrt{3}$. Second expression: $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8$.

## Step 3: Simplify each expression further.
First expression: $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. To combine the terms, we need a common denominator for the second term, which would be $\sqrt{3}$. Thus, $4\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$: $\frac{11}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
Second expression: $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8 = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8 = 7 - 8 = -1$.

## Step 4: Calculate the final value for the first expression.
The first expression simplifies to $\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 5: The problem asks us to calculate both expressions separately, so we have two final answers.
First expression: $\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Second expression: $-1$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-1}$","The final answer for the ground truth solution is $\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$ for the first expression and $-1$ for the second expression.

The candidate solution provides the correct final answer of $-1$ for the second expression but does not explicitly state the final answer for the first expression. Instead, it mentions the simplified form of the first expression as $\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$ in Step 4, but this is not boxed as a final answer.

The candidate solution's reasoning is mostly correct, but it misses the mark in a few places:
- In Step 1, the simplification of $\sqrt{27}$ is correct, but the simplification of $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$ is incorrect. It should be $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$ instead of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
- In Step 3, the simplification of the first expression is incorrect. It should be $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$, as shown in the ground truth solution.
- The candidate solution does not provide the correct final answer for the first expression, which is a requirement for a correct solution.",False

3. Subtract 8 from the simplified fraction:

   - $7 - 8 = -1$.

Final Answer: $\boxed{-1}$.",1,"## Step 1: First, let's solve the square roots in the first expression given: $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.
$\sqrt{27}$ can be simplified as $\sqrt{9 \times 3}$, which equals $3\sqrt{3}$ because $\sqrt{9} = 3$. $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$ can be expressed as $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$, resulting in $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. So, the expression becomes $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3}$.

## Step 2: Next, let's simplify the first expression further by combining like terms.
We have $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3}$. This can be rewritten as $3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Combining the $3\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ gives us $4\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. To combine these terms, we find a common denominator, which results in $\frac{12\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. This simplifies to $\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

## Step 3: Now, let's address the second expression: $\frac{\sqrt{32}+\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}-8$.
$\sqrt{32}$ can be simplified as $\sqrt{16 \times 2}$, which equals $4\sqrt{2}$ because $\sqrt{16} = 4$. $\sqrt{18}$ can be simplified as $\sqrt{9 \times 2}$, which equals $3\sqrt{2}$ because $\sqrt{9} = 3$. So, the expression becomes $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} - 8$.

## Step 4: Simplify the second expression further by combining like terms in the numerator and then dividing by $\sqrt{2}$.
Combining $4\sqrt{2}$ and $3\sqrt{2}$ gives $7\sqrt{2}$. Dividing by $\sqrt{2}$, we get $\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$, which simplifies to $7$ because $\sqrt{2}$ cancels out. So, the expression becomes $7 - 8$.

## Step 5: Calculate the final value of the second expression.
$7 - 8 = -1$.

## Step 6: Since the problem asks us to calculate both expressions separately, we have completed the calculations for both expressions.
The first expression simplifies to $\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$ and the second expression simplifies to $-1$.

245856,"The strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$ is ____.","To analyze the strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$, we follow these steps:

1. We first transform the given function for simplicity:
\[ y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x \]

2. By using trigonometric identities, we can express this as a single sine function:
\[ y=2\sin\left(x+\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \]

3. For a sine function, the interval where it's decreasing is between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, considering the periodic nature of sine. Therefore, we set the inside of the sine function within these bounds:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi \leqslant x+\frac{\pi}{3} \leqslant \frac{3\pi}{2}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

4. Solving for $x$ in the inequality:
\[ \frac{\pi}{6}+2k\pi \leqslant x \leqslant \frac{7\pi}{6}+2k\pi, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z} \]

5. Given $x\in \left[0,2\pi \right]$, we find the intersection of this domain with the solution from step 4. This step ensures that we only consider the valid $x$ values within the given interval.

6. By analyzing the bounds and the periodic nature of the sine function, we conclude that for $k=0$ (since $x$ is within $[0, 2\pi]$), the decreasing interval is:
\[ \left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right] \]

Therefore, the strict decreasing interval of the function $y=\sin x+\sqrt{3}\cos x$ on the interval $\left[0,2\pi \right]$ is $\boxed{\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]}$.",0,"## Step 1: Identify the function and interval
The function given is $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ on the interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$.

## Step 2: Determine the derivative of the function
To find the intervals where the function is strictly decreasing, we need to find the derivative of the function. The derivative $y'$ of $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ is $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x$.

## Step 3: Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points
To find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero: $\cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x = 0$. This can be rewritten as $\cos x = \sqrt{3} \sin x$.

## Step 4: Solve for x
Dividing both sides by $\cos x$ (assuming $\cos x \neq 0$), we get $1 = \sqrt{3} \tan x$. Thus, $\tan x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. This implies $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ or $x = \frac{7\pi}{6}$ in the interval $\left[0, 2\pi\right]$ because $\tan x$ is positive in the first and third quadrants.

## Step 5: Determine the sign of the derivative in the intervals defined by the critical points
We must examine the sign of $y' = \cos x - \sqrt{3} \sin x$ in the intervals $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$, $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$, and $\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$ to determine where the function is decreasing.

## Step 6: Analyze the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = 0$, we find $y' = 1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = 1 > 0$. Thus, the function is increasing in this interval.

## Step 7: Analyze the interval $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = \pi$, we find $y' = -1 - \sqrt{3} \cdot 0 = -1 < 0$. Thus, the function is decreasing in this interval.

## Step 8: Analyze the interval $\left(\frac{7\pi}{6}, 2\pi\right]$
Choosing a test point in this interval, such as $x = \frac{4\pi}{3}$, we find $y' = -\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 1 > 0$. Thus, the function is increasing in this interval.

## Step 9: Conclusion
From the analysis, the function $y = \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right)}$","The final answer provided by the ground truth solution is $\boxed{\left[\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\right]}$.
