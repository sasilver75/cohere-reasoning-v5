137187,"Given an isosceles triangle with two sides measuring $3cm$ and $7cm$, the perimeter of the triangle is ( ).

A: $13cm$

B: $13cm$ or $17cm$

C: $17cm$

D: $16cm$","To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible configurations of the isosceles triangle given the side lengths of $3cm$ and $7cm$. An isosceles triangle has at least two sides that are equal in length.

1. **First Configuration: $3cm$ as the Equal Sides**

- If we consider the $3cm$ sides to be the equal sides, we would have two sides of $3cm$ and one side of $7cm$. However, for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In this case, $3cm + 3cm = 6cm$, which is not greater than $7cm$. Therefore, this configuration does not form a valid triangle.

2. **Second Configuration: $7cm$ as the Equal Sides**

- If we consider the $7cm$ sides to be the equal sides, we have two sides of $7cm$ each and one side of $3cm$. This configuration satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as $7cm + 7cm > 3cm$ and $7cm + 3cm > 7cm$. The perimeter of this triangle would be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = 7cm + 7cm + 3cm = 17cm
  \]

Therefore, the correct perimeter of the triangle, given the side lengths, is $17cm$. 

Thus, the correct answer is $\boxed{C}$.",0,"We are given an isosceles triangle, which means two of its sides are equal in length.

Let's denote the unknown side as $x$.

Given:
- Side 1 = 3 cm
- Side 2 = 7 cm
- Side 3 = $x$ cm

Since the perimeter is the sum of all side lengths, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

Plugging in the values:

Perimeter = 3 cm + 7 cm + $x$ cm

Combining like terms:

Perimeter = 10 cm + $x$ cm

Now, we know that the third side, $x$, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, as this is a right triangle:

$x^2 = 7^2 + 3^2$
$x^2 = 49 + 9$
$x^2 = 58$
$x = \sqrt{58}$

So, the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 10 cm + $\sqrt{58}$ cm

This is approximately **16.22 cm**, but the question asks for an exact value.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**$\boxed{17cm}$**","The final answer from the ground truth solution is **C: 17cm**.

The candidate solution provides the answer as **$\boxed{17cm}$**.

The candidate solution is incorrect in its approach. While it correctly identifies that the isosceles triangle has two equal sides, it incorrectly assumes that the triangle is a right triangle. This assumption leads to the use of the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the third side, which is not applicable in this case. 

The correct approach, as outlined in the ground truth solution, is to consider the possible configurations of the isosceles triangle and apply the triangle inequality theorem to determine the valid configuration. The candidate solution does not consider this crucial step and, as a result, provides an incorrect method for finding the third side length.",False
174230,Solve for the set of $x$ in the inequality $x^2 - x - 5 > 3x$.,"First, we bring all terms to the left side of the inequality, to obtain:
\[ x^2 - x - 5 - 3x > 0 \]
Simplifying the inequality, we have:
\[ x^2 - 4x - 5 > 0 \]
Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left side of the inequality:
\[ (x - 5)(x + 1) > 0 \]
For the product of two terms to be greater than zero, both terms must be greater than zero, or both must be less than zero. Therefore, we divide our analysis into two cases:

1. Both terms are positive:
   For the first term $(x-5) > 0$, the solution is $x > 5$.
   For the second term $(x+1) > 0$, the solution is $x > -1$. 
   The common solution is the intersection of these two, which is $x > 5$.

2. Both terms are negative:
   For the first term $(x-5) < 0$, the solution is $x < 5$.
   For the second term $(x+1) < 0$, the solution is $x < -1$.
   The common solution is the intersection of these two, which is $x < -1$.

Combining these two cases, the solution set for the inequality is the union of the intervals $x > 5$ and $x < -1$:
\[ \boxed{\{x | x > 5 \text{ or } x < -1\}} \]",0,"We can solve this problem as follows:

The expression $(x - 5)(x + 1)$ is positive when either both factors are positive or both are negative. The first factor is positive when $x > 5$, and the second factor is positive when $x > -1$. The first factor is negative when $x < 5$, and the second factor is negative when $x < -1$.

To find the negation of $p$, we can write it as:

$¬p$: $∃x > 2$, $log _{2}(x+ \frac {4}{x}) \leq 2$.

Now, let's check the truth value of $¬p$ by considering the function $f(x) = log _{2}(x+ \frac {4}{x}) - 2$. We want to find when $f(x) \leq 0$.

Differentiating $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

$f'(x) = \frac{1}{(x+\frac{4}{x})\ln(2)} - \frac{4}{x^2(x+\frac{4}{x})\ln(2)} = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x^2(x+\frac{4}{x})\ln(2)}$.

Setting $f'(x) = 0$, we find the critical points:

$x^2 - 4 = 0 \implies x = \pm 2$.

Since we are interested in $x > 2$, we consider $x = 2$ as a critical point.

Evaluating $f(2) = log _{2}(2+ \frac {4}{2}) - 2 = 0$, we find that $f(2) = 0$.

As $x$ increases from $2$, $f(x)$ becomes negative, which means $f(x) \leq 0$ for $x > 2$.

This question examines the negation of propositions, the negation relationship between universal propositions and particular propositions, and the judgment of the truth or falsity of propositions, which is a basic question.",1,"We can start by simplifying the given proposition $p$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\forall x > 2, \log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) > 2 \, .
\end{equation*}
$$

This statement is true for all $x > 2$. To find the negation of this statement, we can use the following rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
\neg(\forall x P(x)) &\equiv \exists x \neg P(x) \\
\neg(\forall x > 2, \log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) > 2) &\equiv \exists x > 2, \log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) \leq 2 \, .

So, the negation of $p$ is:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\exists x > 2, \log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) \leq 2 \, .

$$

Now, we need to determine if this negation is a true proposition. Let's consider the function $f(x) = \log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) - 2$ and find the values of $x$ for which $f(x) \leq 0$.

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &\leq 0 \\

\log_2(x + \frac{4}{x}) &\leq 2 \\
2^{\log_2(x + \frac{4}{x})} &\leq 2^2 \\
x + \frac{4}{x} &\leq 4 \, .

Now, let's solve the inequality:

$$
\begin{align*}
x + \frac{4}{x} &\leq 4 \\
x^2 + 4 &\leq 4x \\
x^2 - 4x + 4 &\leq 0 \\
(x - 2)^2 &\leq 0 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

The solution to this inequality is $x = 2$. However, we are interested in values greater than $2$, so we take $x > 2$.

Substituting $x = 3$ into the original inequality, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
3 + \frac{4}{3} &\approx 3.44 > 2 \, .

So, there exists an $x > 2$ for which the inequality holds. Therefore, the negation of $p$ is a true statement.

239483,"The equation for a circle that passes through the origin, with its center on the negative x-axis and a radius equal to 2, is __________.","Let's denote the center of the circle as $(a, 0)$, with $a < 0$. 
Since the radius of the circle is 2, the equation of the circle is $(x - a)^2 + y^2 = 4$.

Moreover, since the origin $O(0, 0)$ lies on the circle, by substituting these coordinates into the circle's equation, we get:
$$(0 - a)^2 + 0^2 = 4.$$
Hence, we have $a^2 = 4$. Solving for $a$ yields $a = -2$ (the positive root is disregarded as $a$ is negative according to the problem statement).

Consequently, the equation of the circle is given by:
$$(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = 4.$$
So, the answer is:
$$\boxed{(x+2)^2+y^2=4}.$$

The problem requires determining the standard equation of a circle based on given conditions, focusing on the knowledge of the circle's standard equation and the relationship between points and the circle's position. This is considered a basic-level question.",0,"Let's break down the problem and solve it systematically.

We are given that the circle passes through the origin, which means the origin $(0, 0)$ is a point on the circle.

The center of the circle is on the negative x-axis, which means the x-coordinate of the center is negative, and the y-coordinate is zero. Let's denote the center as $(-a, 0)$, where $a$ is a positive number since it is on the negative x-axis.

The radius of the circle is given as 2.

Now, we can use the equation of a circle, which is:

$$
\begin{equation*}
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\, ,
\end{equation*}
$$

where $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the center, and $r$ is the radius.

Plugging in the values, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
(x + a)^2 + y^2 &= 2^2 \\
x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 &= 4\, .

Since the circle passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, we can plug these coordinates into the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
0^2 + 2a(0) + a^2 + 0^2 &= 4 \\
a^2 &= 4 \\
a &= \pm 2\, .
\end{align*}
$$

We know that $a$ is positive because the center is on the negative x-axis, so $a = 2$.

Now, we can write the equation of the circle:

$$
\boxed{x^2 + 2(2)x + 2^2 + y^2 = 4} \, .
