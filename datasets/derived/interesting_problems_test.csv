\[
\sqrt{2} = \frac{a+b}{c} \implies a+b = \sqrt{2}c \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Given that the area of right triangle $\triangle ABC$ is $4$, and knowing the formula for the area of a right triangle is $\frac{1}{2}ab$, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}ab = 4 \implies ab = 8 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Since $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\angle C = 90^{\circ}$, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \quad \text{(3)}
\]

Substituting equation (1) into equation (3) and using equation (2), we get:

\[
c^2 = (\sqrt{2}c)^2 - 2ab = 2c^2 - 16 \implies c^2 = 16 \implies c = \pm 4
\]

Since $c$ represents a length, we discard $c = -4$ and keep $c = 4$. Substituting $c = 4$ into equation (1), we find:

\[
a+b = \sqrt{2} \cdot 4 = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$, which is $a+b+c$, is:

\[
a+b+c = 4\sqrt{2} + 4
\]

Hence, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{4\sqrt{2} + 4}$.",0,"We are given that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of a right triangle, and we have a Pythagorean reciprocal function of the form:

$$
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{a+b}{cx}

$$

We know that point $P(1, \sqrt{2})$ lies on this graph, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{2} & = \frac{a+b}{c} \cdot 1 \\
\sqrt{2} & = \frac{a+b}{c}
\end{align*}
$$

We also know that the area of the triangle is $4$, which can be expressed using the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Area} & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b \\
4 & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b \\
8 & = a \cdot b

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate $a$, $b$, and $c$:

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2 + b^2 & = c^2 \\
c^2 & = a^2 + b^2
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting the value of $a+b$ from the equation of the line, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
c^2 & = \left(\frac{c\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \\
c^2 & = \frac{2c^2}{4} + \frac{2c^2}{4} \\
c^2 & = \frac{2c^2}{2} \\
c^2 & = c^2

$$

This doesn't provide us with any new information, so we need to consider the given area of the triangle. We know that $8 = ab$, and we can substitute this into the equation for $c^2$:

$$
\begin{align*}
c^2 & = \left(\frac{8}{b}\right)^2 + b^2 \\
c^2 & = \frac{64}{b^2} + b^2
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can use the fact that the area is $4$ to find the value of $b$. Substituting $8 = ab$ into the area formula, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
4 & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b \\
8 & = a \cdot b \\
8 & = \frac{8}{b} \cdot b \\
8 & = 8
\end{align*}
$$

This doesn't help us find a unique value for $b$, as any value will satisfy this equation. However, we can use the fact that $a$, $b$, and $c$ form a Pythagorean triple. The only Pythagorean triple that satisfies $ab = 8$ and has an area of $4$ is $(3, 4, 5)$. So, we can assume that $a = 3$, $b = 4$, and $c = 5$.

\sqrt{2} \cdot c - b &= \frac{8}{b} \, , \\
b^2 - \sqrt{2} \cdot c \cdot b + 8 &= 0 \, .

b &= \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot c \pm \sqrt{2c^2 - 32}}{2} \, .

Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of a right triangle, they must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $a = \frac{8}{b}$ and the above value of $b$, we get:

$$\begin{align*}

\frac{64}{b^2} &= 8 \, , \\
b^2 &= 8 \, , \\
b &= \pm \sqrt{8} \, .

**Part (Ⅰ):**

To find the probability that at least $3$ people need the device, we can calculate the probabilities of exactly $3$ people and all $4$ people needing the device, and then sum these probabilities.

- The probability that exactly $3$ people need the device is the sum of the probabilities of all combinations of $3$ people out of the $4$ needing the device.

- The probability that all $4$ people need the device is $0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.4 = \boxed{0.06}$.

- $ABD$: $0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.12$
- $ACD$: $0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.12$

The total probability for exactly $3$ people is $0.15 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.10 = \boxed{0.49}$.

The probability of exactly $4$ people needing the device is $0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.4 = \boxed{0.06}$.

To find the expected value of $X$, we calculate the sum of the products of each possible value of $X$ and its corresponding probability.

- $X = 0$: The probability is $(1 - 0.6)(1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.4) = 0.08$.

- $X = 1$: There are $4$ ways this can happen (each person individually). The probability for each case is the product of their probability and the probabilities of the others not needing the device, e.g., for person A: $0.6 \cdot (1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.4) = 0.12$. The total probability for $X = 1$ is $4 \cdot 0.12 = 0.48$.

- $X = 2$: We calculate the probability for one specific case, e.g., A and B needing the device, and multiply by the number of combinations, which is $4$ choose $2 = 6$. The probability is $0.6 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.5)(1 - 0.4) = 0.09$. The total probability for $X = 2$ is $6 \cdot 0.09 = 0.54$.

- $X = 3$: As calculated in Part (Ⅰ), the probability is $0.06$.

- $X = 4$: Also calculated in Part (Ⅰ), the probability is $0.06$.

The expected value of $X$ is the sum of $X$ times its probability:

$$
\begin{align*}
E(X) &= 0 \cdot 0.08 + 1 \cdot 0.48 + 2 \cdot 0.54 + 3 \cdot 0.06 + 4 \cdot 0.06 \\
&= 0.48 + 1.08 + 0.18 + 0.24 \\
&= \boxed{2.04} \, \text{people}.
\end{align*}
$$

So, the expected number of people needing the device on a working day is approximately $2.04$.","The final answer provided in the ground truth solution is **0.31** for part (Ⅰ) and **2** for part (Ⅱ).

The candidate solution provides the following answers:
- 0.12 for part (Ⅰ)
- 2.04 for part (Ⅱ)

The candidate solution is incorrect for both parts.

For part (Ⅰ), the candidate solution only considers the cases where exactly 3 people or all 4 people need the device. However, the ground truth solution also includes cases where 3 people need the device and one person does not. This is a crucial consideration due to the independence of each person's need for the device. By not accounting for these cases, the candidate solution underestimates the probability.

For part (Ⅱ), the candidate solution's approach is correct, but there are errors in the calculations. Specifically:
- For $X = 0$, the probability should be $(1 - 0.6)(1 - 0.5)^2(1 - 0.4) = 0.06$, not 0.08.
- For $X = 1$, the probability for each person is correctly calculated as 0.12, but there are only 4 cases, not 5. So, the total probability should be $4 \cdot 0.12 = 0.48$.
- For $X = 2$, the probability for a specific case is correctly calculated as 0.09, but there are only 6 combinations, not 10. So, the total probability should be $6 \cdot 0.09 = 0.54$.
- The rest of the calculations are correct.

Correcting these errors would yield the expected value as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
E(X) &= 0 \cdot 0.06 + 1 \cdot 0.48 + 2 \cdot 0.54 + 3 \cdot 0.06 + 4 \cdot 0.06 \\
&= 0.48 + 1.08 + 0.12 + 0.24 \\
&= 2.
\end{align*}

\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine $\sin(2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x$, we have:

\[
f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin(2x) - \frac{1}{2} \cos(2x).
\]

Now, express $f(x)$ as a single trigonometric function:

\[
f(x) = \sin \left(2x - \frac{\pi}{6}\right).
\]

The smallest positive period, $T$, for $f(x)$ can be determined from the argument of the sine function:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi.
\]

Thus, the smallest positive period is $\boxed{\pi}$.

(II) When $x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$, the argument of the sine function $2x - \frac{\pi}{6}$ is within $\left[-\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}\right]$. The maximum value of $f(x)$:

If $2x - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$, we obtain $f_{\text{max}}(x) = 1$.

The minimum value of $f(x)$:

If $2x - \frac{\pi}{6} = -\frac{\pi}{6}$, then $x = 0$, we obtain $f_{\text{min}}(x) = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $f(x)$ on $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$ is $\boxed{1}$, and the minimum value is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.",0,"We will solve this problem in two parts:

**Part I: Finding the smallest positive period of $f(x)$**

The dot product of the given vectors is:

$$
\begin{align*}
    f(x) & = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} \\
    & = (\cos x, -\frac{1}{2}) \cdot (\sin x, \cos 2x) \\
    & = \cos x \sin x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \, .
\end{align*}
$$

We can simplify this expression using the double-angle formula for $\cos 2x$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \cos x \sin x - \frac{1}{2} (1 - 2 \sin^2 x) \, .
\end{equation*}
$$

Now, we can rewrite this as:

$$
\begin{align*}
    f(x) & = \cos x \sin x - \frac{1}{2} + \sin^2 x \\
    & = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x + \sin^2 x \, .
\end{align*}
$$

The function $f(x)$ is a combination of $\sin 2x$ and $\sin^2 x$, both of which have a period of $\pi$. However, to find the smallest positive period, we need to consider the least value of $k$ such that $f(x + k\pi) = f(x)$ for all $x$.

For $\sin 2x$, the smallest positive period is $\pi/2$. For $\sin^2 x$, the function repeats every $\pi$ units, but it also exhibits symmetry about $x = \pi/2$. So, the smallest positive period for $\sin^2 x$ is also $\pi/2$.

Therefore, the smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is the least common multiple of $\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$, which is $\boxed{\pi/2}$.

**Part II: Finding the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$**

We have found that $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x + \sin^2 x$. To find the maximum and minimum values on the given interval, we can analyze the behavior of $f(x)$:

- On the interval $[0, \pi/2]$, $\sin 2x$ increases from $0$ to $1$, and $\sin^2 x$ increases from $0$ to $1$.
- The term $\sin^2 x$ is always non-negative on this interval.
- The maximum value of $f(x)$ occurs when both $\sin 2x$ and $\sin^2 x$ are at their maximum, which is at $x = \pi/2$. At this point, $f(\pi/2) = \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = 0$, where $f(0) = 0 + 0^2 = 0$.

So, the maximum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ is $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$, and the minimum value is $\boxed{0}$.

f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos x \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} \sin x \\ \cos 2x \end{pmatrix} = \cos x \sin x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x.
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine $\sin(2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x$, we have:

\[
f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin(2x) - \frac{1}{2} \cos(2x).
\]

Now, express $f(x)$ as a single trigonometric function:

\[
f(x) = \sin \left(2x - \frac{\pi}{6}\right).
\]

The smallest positive period, $T$, for $f(x)$ can be determined from the argument of the sine function:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi.
\]

Thus, the smallest positive period is $\boxed{\pi}$.

(II) When $x \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$, the argument of the sine function $2x - \frac{\pi}{6}$ is within $\left[-\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}\right]$. The maximum value of $f(x)$:

If $2x - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$, we obtain $f_{\text{max}}(x) = 1$.

The minimum value of $f(x)$:

If $2x - \frac{\pi}{6} = -\frac{\pi}{6}$, then $x = 0$, we obtain $f_{\text{min}}(x) = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $f(x)$ on $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$ is $\boxed{1}$, and the minimum value is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.",1,"We are given the vectors:

$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{a} &= ( \cos x, -\frac{1}{2} ) \\
\vec{b} &= (\sin x, \cos 2x) \, .
\end{align*}
$$

(I) To find the smallest positive period of $f(x) = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$, we need to determine the values of $x$ for which $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ repeat their directions.

For vector $\vec{a}$, the $x$-component repeats its direction every $2\pi$ units, as $\cos x$ has a period of $2\pi$.

For vector $\vec{b}$, the $x$-component, $\sin x$, has a period of $2\pi$, and the $y$-component, $\cos 2x$, has a period of $\pi$. So, the vector $\vec{b}$ repeats its direction every $\pi$ units.

Therefore, the smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is the least common multiple of $2\pi$ and $\pi$, which is $\boxed{2\pi}$.

(II) To find the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$, we first calculate $f(x)$:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} \\
&= \cos x \cdot \sin x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we find the critical points of $f(x)$ in the given interval:

$$
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \sin x \cdot \cos x + \cos x \cdot \sin x - \frac{1}{2} (-2 \sin 2x) \\
&= 2 \cos x \sin x + \sin 2x \\
&= 2 \cos x \sin x + 2 \sin x \cos x \\
&= 4 \cos x \sin x \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Setting $f'(x)$ equal to zero and solving for $x$ in the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$:

$$
\begin{align*}
4 \cos x \sin x &= 0 \\
\cos x \sin x &= 0 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

This equation is satisfied when either $\cos x = 0$ or $\sin x = 0$. In the given interval:

- $\cos x = 0$ at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
- $\sin x = 0$ at $x = 0$.

So, the critical points are $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Now, we evaluate $f(x)$ at these critical points and the interval endpoints:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(0) &= \cos 0 \cdot \sin 0 - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \\
f\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= \cos \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \sin \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \cos \pi = -\frac{1}{2} \\
f(0) - f\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= 0 - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \, .
\end{align*}
$$

So, the maximum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$, and it occurs at $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which occurs at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.","The final answer for the ground truth solution is:
- The smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is $\pi$.

The final answer provided by the candidate solution is:
- The smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is $2\pi$.
- The maximum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the minimum value is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

The candidate solution is incorrect. The mistake lies in the calculation of the smallest positive period of $f(x)$. The candidate solution claims that the period is $2\pi$, but this is not the smallest positive period. The smallest positive period is the value that makes the argument of the sine function in $f(x)$ complete a full cycle, which is $\pi$.

Additionally, the candidate solution correctly identifies the critical points of $f(x)$ as $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, but it seems to have evaluated $f(x)$ at these points incorrectly. The correct values are $f(0) = 0$ and $f\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -\frac{1}{2}$, which gives the maximum and minimum values on the interval as stated in the ground truth solution.",False

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x - \frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (\sin 2x - \cos 2x) \, .

(I) To find the smallest positive period of $f(x)$, we need to determine the smallest value of $T$ such that $f(x + T) = f(x)$ for all $x$. In this case, we recognize that $\sin 2x$ and $\cos 2x$ have a period of $2\pi$. Therefore, the smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\pi}$.

(II) To find the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$ on the given interval, we can find the critical points and evaluate $f(x)$ at the endpoints of the interval.

Taking the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, we get:

Solving for $x$ in the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$, we get $x = \frac{\pi}{8}$.

Now, we evaluate $f(x)$ at the critical point and the endpoints:

- $f(0) = \frac{1}{2} (\sin 0 - \cos 0) = -\frac{1}{2}$.
- $f\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\sin \frac{\pi}{4} - \cos \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$.
- $f\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} (\sin \pi - \cos \pi) = 0$.

The correct simplification, as shown in the ground truth solution, is $f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin(2x) - \frac{1}{2} \cos(2x)$.
