Since the function is increasing in the interval $[2,+\infty)$, we have $-a \leqslant 2$.
Solving this inequality, we get $a \geqslant -2$, which implies $a \in [-2,+\infty)$.

To summarize, we found the axis of symmetry, used the monotonicity of the function, and solved the resulting inequality to find the range of values for $a$.

The answer is $\boxed{a \in [-2,+\infty)}$.",0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $a$ for which the given function is increasing on the specified interval. Here are the steps:

**Step 1: Find the derivative of the function**

The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is:

$$
\begin{equation*}
y'=2x+2a\,.
\end{equation*}
$$

**Step 2: Determine the interval where the derivative is positive**

For the function to be increasing on the interval $[2, +\infty)$, the derivative $y'$ must be positive on this interval. Let's set up an inequality:

$$
\begin{equation*}
2x + 2a > 0 \text{ for } x \in [2, +\infty)\,.
\end{equation*}
$$

Now, we can solve for $a$:

- For $x = 2$, we have:

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  2(2) + 2a &> 0\\
  4 + 2a &> 0\\
  2a &> -4\\
  a &> -2\,.
  \end{align*}
  $$

- For $x > 2$, the term $2x$ is positive, so the inequality is always satisfied.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The function $y = x^2 + 2ax + 1$ is increasing on the interval $[2, +\infty)$ for all real numbers $a$ greater than $-2$.

So, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{a > -2}\,.
$$","The final answer from the ground truth solution is $a \in [-2,+\infty)$.

The candidate solution provides the answer $a > -2$, which is not the same as the ground truth solution. The candidate solution is incorrect because it only considers the case where $x = 2$ and does not take into account the entire interval $[2, +\infty)$. The inequality $2x + 2a > 0$ is not always satisfied for $x > 2$; it depends on the value of $a$. For example, if $a = -3$, the inequality is not satisfied for any $x > 2$.",False

The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    y' = 2x + 2a\,.
\end{equation*}
$$

**Step 2: Determine the interval where the derivative is positive**

For the function to be increasing on the interval $[2, +\infty)$, the derivative $y'$ must be positive on this interval. Let's set the derivative greater than zero and solve for $x$:

$$
\begin{align*}
    2x + 2a &> 0 \\
    2x &> -2a \\
    x &> -a\,.
\end{align*}
$$

So, for $x > -a$, the derivative is positive.

**Step 3: Find the range of $a$**

Given the interval $[2, +\infty)$, we need $x > 2$ to satisfy the inequality $x > -a$. Therefore:

$$
\begin{align*}
    x > 2 &> -a \\
    \implies -a &> -2 \\
    \implies a &< 2\,.

So, the range of values for $a$ is $\boxed{(-2, 2)}$.

In Step 3, the candidate solution incorrectly concludes that $a < 2$. The inequality $x > 2 > -a$ does not imply $-a > -2$. Instead, it should be noted that for $x > 2$, the inequality $x > -a$ is always true, regardless of the value of $a$.

**Step 2: Determine the critical points**

The critical points are the values of $x$ where the derivative is zero or undefined. In this case, the derivative is a linear function, so it is never undefined, and it is zero when:

$$

2x + 2a &= 0\\

**Step 3: Check the sign of the derivative on the given interval**

We are interested in the interval $[2, +\infty)$. So, we check the sign of the derivative for $x > -a$:

- If $a < 0$, then $y' > 0$ for all $x > -a$, which includes the given interval.
- If $a \geq 0$, then $y'$ is negative for some values of $x$ in the given interval (specifically, when $-a < x < 0$).

Using the double-angle identity for sine $\sin(2x) = 2 \sin x \cos x$, we have:

\[
f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin(2x) - \frac{1}{2} \cos(2x).
\]

Now, express $f(x)$ as a single trigonometric function:

\[
f(x) = \sin \left(2x - \frac{\pi}{6}\right).
\]

The smallest positive period, $T$, for $f(x)$ can be determined from the argument of the sine function:

\[
T = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi.
\]

Thus, the smallest positive period is $\boxed{\pi}$.

If $2x - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$, we obtain $f_{\text{max}}(x) = 1$.

The minimum value of $f(x)$:

If $2x - \frac{\pi}{6} = -\frac{\pi}{6}$, then $x = 0$, we obtain $f_{\text{min}}(x) = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $f(x)$ on $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]$ is $\boxed{1}$, and the minimum value is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.",0,"We start by finding the dot product of the two vectors:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \cos x \sin x - \frac{1}{2} (1 - 2 \sin^2 x) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x + \sin^2 x \, .

(I) To find the smallest positive period of $f(x)$, we need to determine the smallest value of $T$ such that $f(x + T) = f(x)$ for all $x$. In this case, we can observe that $\sin 2x$ has a period of $2\pi$, and $\sin^2 x$ has a period of $\pi$. Therefore, the smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is the least common multiple of $2\pi$ and $\pi$, which is $\boxed{2\pi}$.

(II) To find the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$ on the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$, we can differentiate $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and find the critical points:

This equation is satisfied when $\tan 2x = -1$, which occurs at $x = \frac{3\pi}{8}$ and $x = \frac{7\pi}{8}$ in the interval $\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$.

Now, we can evaluate $f(x)$ at these critical points and the interval endpoints:

- $f(0) = \frac{1}{2} \sin 0 + \sin^2 0 = 0$.
- $f\left(\frac{3\pi}{8}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \sin \frac{3\pi}{4} + \sin^2 \frac{3\pi}{8} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 2 - \sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{4}$.

The candidate solution is incorrect. The main issue lies in the calculation of the smallest positive period. In the candidate solution, it is assumed that the smallest positive period is the least common multiple of the periods of $\sin 2x$ and $\sin^2 x$. However, this is not the case.

By doing so, we find that $f(x)$ is a sine function with an argument of $2x - \frac{\pi}{6}$. The smallest positive period for a sine function is always $2\pi$, and this is the period of the argument. Therefore, the smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is $\pi$.

Additionally, the candidate solution's approach to finding the maximum and minimum values on the given interval is flawed.

For vector $\vec{b}$, the $x$-component, $\sin x$, has a period of $2\pi$, and the $y$-component, $\cos 2x$, has a period of $\pi$. So, the vector $\vec{b}$ repeats its direction every $\pi$ units.

For $2x = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2k\pi$, we get $x = \frac{3\pi}{4} + k\pi$, which is outside the given interval.

The candidate solution is incorrect. The mistake lies in the calculation of the smallest positive period of $f(x)$. The candidate solution claims that the period is $2\pi$, but this is not the smallest positive period. The smallest positive period is the least common multiple of the periods of the individual components of the vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. For $\vec{a}$, the $x$-component has a period of $2\pi$, and for $\vec{b}$, the $x$-component has a period of $2\pi$, and the $y$-component has a period of $\pi$. Therefore, the smallest positive period of $f(x)$ is $\pi$, not $2\pi$.

Additionally, the candidate solution's calculation of the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$ on the given interval is incorrect. The critical point $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$ does not yield the maximum or minimum value of $f(x)$ within the interval. The correct approach is to use the properties of the sine function and the given interval to determine the maximum and minimum values, as shown in the ground truth solution.",False

Calculate $\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}+\sqrt{3}$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify each term:

   - $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$, because $27 = 3^3$ and $\sqrt{3^3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, because $\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{3^{-1}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
   - $\sqrt{3}$ remains as is.

2. Combine the terms:

   - $3\sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{3} + \frac{3}{3}\sqrt{3}$.
   - This simplifies to $\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

### Problem 2:

Calculate $\frac{\sqrt{32}+\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}-8$.

#### Step-by-step Solution:

1. Simplify the numerator:

   - $\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$, because $32 = 2^5$ and $\sqrt{2^5} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
   - $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$, because $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$ and $\sqrt{2 \cdot 3^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

2. Combine the terms in the numerator and simplify the fraction:

   - $\frac{4\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
   - Since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 1$, this simplifies to $7$.
