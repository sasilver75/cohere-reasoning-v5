it follows that $f'(x) \geq 0$ holds true in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$,

Computing the derivative, we get that
$$f'(x) = a\cos x - \sin x.$$We need this derivative to be positive in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$. 

Now, we use the fact that $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Thus, over the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$, the minimum value of $\sin x$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ and the maximum value of $\cos x$ is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Therefore, for $f'(x) = a\cos x - \sin x$ to be positive in this interval, we must have
$$a \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{1}{2} > 0,$$which gives us the range $a > \sqrt{2}$. On the other hand, we also need to check the critical point in the interval, which is $x = \frac{\pi}{5}$. Evaluating $f$ at this point gives us
$$f\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = a\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right).$$But $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) > \frac{1}{2}$ and $\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) > 0$, so for $f\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) > f\left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = a\cdot \frac{1}{2} + \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{a}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we need $a > 0$.

The candidate solution is incorrect because it fails to consider the full range of values for $x$ in the given interval. While it correctly identifies the critical point $x = \frac{\pi}{5}$ and evaluates the function at this point, it does not account for the fact that $\tan x$ is increasing in the interval $\left( \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4} \right)$. This means that the minimum value of $\tan x$ in this interval is $\tan \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, not $\frac{1}{2}$. As a result, the inequality $a \geq \tan x$ should be used instead of $a > \tan x$, leading to the correct answer of $a \geq 1$."

1. We are given that $P(1, \sqrt{2})$ lies on the graph of the function, and we can find the corresponding $x$ and $y$ values are 1 and $\sqrt{2}$ respectively.

2. From the question, we know that $y = \frac{a + b}{cx}$, so we can say that $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a + b}{cx}$ for some value of $c$. 

3. Next, we know the area of the triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2}bc = 4$. We can use this to solve for $b$:
$\implies 4 = \frac{1}{2}bc

4. Now we can find $a$ using the Pythagorean Theorem. We know that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, so:
$\implies a^2 + \left( \frac{8}{c} \right)^2 = c^2
\implies a^2 + 64/c^2 = c^2
\implies a^2 - 64/c^2 = 0
\implies a^2 = 64/c^2
\implies a = 8/c

5. Now we have both $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$. Substituting these values back into the equation $y = \frac{a+b}{cx}$, we get:
$\sqrt{2} = \frac{8/c + 8/c}{cx}$
$\implies 2 = \frac{16/c}{cx}$
$\implies cx = 8

6. Now, since $P(1, \sqrt{2})$ is on the graph and we've found the value of $cx$, we can find $x$:
$\implies 1 = \frac{8}{cx}
\implies cx = 8

7. Therefore, we have $c = \boxed{2\sqrt{2}}$.

Now that we have the value of $c$, we can find the perimeter using $a = 8/c$ and $b = 8/c$:

$$a+b = \sqrt{2} \cdot c \implies a+b = \sqrt{8} \cdot c$$$$\implies a+b = 2\sqrt{2}c$$

$$a+b = 4c$$
